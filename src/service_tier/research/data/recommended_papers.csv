1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 What is Visual Question Answering?
Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as a significant task in the intersection of computer vision and natural
language processing (NLP). The goal of VQA is to predict an answer 𝐴to a question 𝑄based on visual information 𝑉,
formalized as 𝐴=𝑓(𝑄,𝑉), where𝑓represents the model function [ 23]. Visual inputs may include images of landscapes,
people, or videos, and questions can range from multiple-choice to open-ended formats.
A VQA model typically consists of the following steps. First, features are extracted from visual and textual information
respectively. Then, intra-modal and inter-modal representations are learned by aligning and fusing the features. Finally,
the obtained image-question knowledge representation is predicted to complete the question answering task. We
summarize these natural language and image understanding and inference in Figure 1.
The VQA task was first introduced by Agrawal et al. [ 23] alongside the classic VQA v1 dataset, which contains
614,163 manually curated question-answer pairs based on MS COCO images. The earliest VQA tasks focus on the
direct understanding of visual and textual information, mainly using deep learning methods, in which VGG-Net [ 124],
Faster-RCNN [ 346] are used for visual feature extraction, and LSTM [ 23], GRU are used for textual feature extraction.
The introduction of attention mechanisms marked a pivotal advancement in the field. Stacked attention [ 474] and co-
attention [ 275] frameworks significantly improved the fusion of visual and textual features by learning complementary
information between modalities. Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been increasingly utilized to
capture the complex relationships between visual and textual elements through multimodal heterogeneous graphs [ 87].

In recent years, the Transformer architecture [ 419] has further revolutionized VQA. Visual-language pre-training
models such as BLIP [ 241] leverage self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance multimodal fusion,
enabling significant progress in zero-shot VQA. Emerging multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including
Flamingo [ 14], BLIP-2 [ 242], InternVL [ 62] have demonstrated exceptional performance, particularly in open-ended
and zero-shot question answering scenarios.
While early VQA models focused on direct feature extraction and alignment, recent advances have shifted toward
knowledge-based reasoning, which goes beyond perception to deeper cognitive understanding. Some approaches
explore how to transform fragmented internal knowledge into structured knowledge. Knowledge can be represented as
the form of knowledge triplets and applied to one-hop or multi-hop reasoning [ 87]. Other approaches form a joint image-
question-knowledge representation by introducing an external knowledge base [ 143] or performing passage retrieval
[109]. Then this joint representation is utilized for reasoning. Compared with the previous work, the understanding of
the knowledge representation coming from images and texts at this stage is more in-depth. In addition, Multimodal
large language models now integrate sophisticated reasoning methods such as instruction tuning and Chain-of-Thought
prompting to improve answer accuracy. In this respect, VQA is a comprehensive task that bridges computer vision and
natural language processing (NLP). On the one hand, computer vision aims to teach machines how to see, working on
ways to acquire, process, and understand images. NLP, on the other hand, is a field concerned with enabling interactions
between computers and humans in natural language, which not only aims to teach machines how to read but also
pays attention to the thought process of question answering. It is worth noting that natural language generation
methods play an important role in VQA, since it has a non-negligible role in the answer generation process, especially
contributing to assisting the model to achieve better results in open-ended question answering.
VQA’s impact extends across diverse applications, from aiding visually impaired users in navigating digital and
real-world environments to improving image retrieval, autonomous driving, medical diagnostics, and conversational AI
systems [ 35,385]. The task can also evolve into visual dialogue, where systems must answer questions based on an
entire conversation history, further highlighting its potential in real-world problem-solving.
1.2 Comparison with Other Survey Works
Over the years, Visual Question Answering (VQA) has garnered significant attention in the research community, leading
to the publication of numerous high-quality surveys. These surveys provide valuable insights for both beginners and
experienced researchers by outlining challenges, recent trends, and open problems. Table 1 highlights some of the
prominent generalized surveys in the field.
In 2017, Wu et al. [ 445] provide a foundational review, offering an overall definition of VQA task types and a
comprehensive overview of existing models. However, their survey did not cover more advanced VQA approaches. That
same year, Kafle et al. [ 182] review VQA tasks with a focus on datasets and evaluation metrics, discussing the challenges
and limitations of existing methods. Zhang et al. [ 495] later review information fusion methods in VQA, categorizing
them into two-channel and multi-channel fusion strategies. While this work advanced the understanding of multimodal
fusion, it provides limited insights into other critical components of the task. By 2020, Srivastava et al. [ 392] highlight
the latest applications of deep learning methods in VQA, offering a detailed analysis of model performance. Patel et al.
[324] further contribute by focusing on video-based question answering, emphasizing temporal information processing.
More recently, Faria et al. [ 79] explore the language bias problem in VQA, providing detailed analyses of scene-text
datasets and strategies to address bias. Barra et al. [ 35] and Singh et al. [ 385] offered shorter surveys that summarized
recent advances in neural network-based models, pre-trained language models, and their applications. Additionally,

2 COMPREHENSION OF IMAGE AND TEXT IN VQA
2.1 Feature Extraction
The majority of VQA models require modal feature extraction prior to answering questions, which can be used for
subsequent multimodal feature fusion to eliminate the gap between modals.
2.1.1 Visual Feature Extraction. For visual feature extraction, on the one hand, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
(e.g., VGG-Net [ 382], GoogleNet [ 400] and ResNet [ 139]) are often used to extract global image features in early VQA
tasks. VGG-Net [ 382] increases the convolutional layers to 19 and replaces 5×5with 3×3convolutions, reducing
parameters and enhancing nonlinear mapping for improved expressive ability. ResNet [ 139] introduces residual blocks
to mitigate gradient issues in deeper networks, weakening strong connections. On the other hand, Visual Transformer
(ViT) [ 93] applies the Transformer [ 419] framework to extract image features and compute attention map of the image
by attending each pixel to every other pixel. Based on this, CLIP [ 341] shows the strong performance to extract features
on pixel-level, and further becomes a widely-used image encoder to assistant the vision-language pretraining models
and multimodal large language models with pixel-level image understanding ability.
Using global image features to perform VQA task weakens the relationship between tasks and objects in the image,
so numerous models prominent the task-relevant regions by extracting region-based image features. Actually, it is a
spatial-attention mechanism to extract finer-grained features. They first select the regions of interest to the task and
input them into CNNs to extract region features. Specifically, there are two ways to extract region-based features. One is
based on the uniform grid [ 174]. By dividing image into uniformly sampled grids, the region features corresponding to

each grids can be achieved after inputting them into CNNs. And the relevance weight of each grid feature is determined
by the task. Another way is based on region proposal, which applys object recognition techniques to generate bounding
boxs for the image, then inputs them with their corresponding size and position information into CNNs to extract
region features. Compared with global-based features, this can better identify objects attribute, quantity and location
relationship [17]. The commonly used object recognition techniques is Faster RCNN [346].
For VQA tasks with video input, temporal channels are typical employed for visual feature extraction. Two common
approaches are utilized for this purpose. One is C3D [ 412], which scales convolutional networks to three dimensions to
capture temporal information effectively. Alternatively, optical flow [ 102] can be used to extract video features. This
method analyzes pixel movement and frame-to-frame correlation to capture temporal dynamics. Please refer to Table 2
and Fig. 3 for a summary of various methods for extracting visual features.
2.1.2 Textual Feature Extraction. Another crucial aspect is the extraction of texture features. Classic models for text
encoding include Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Word2Vec [ 298]. With the emergence of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
Manuscript submitted to ACMNatural Language Understanding and Inference with MLLM in Visual Question Answering: A Survey 7
models like LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU have been extensively utilized for handling sequential data. In addition, CNNs,
originally prominent in computer vision, have also been applied for text feature extraction. Word2Vec, RNN and
CNN are all common models for extracting textual features until the advent of Bert [ 85]. Bert, namely Bi-directional
Encoder Representation from Transformers, is a pre-training model proposed by Google AI in 2018. Bert’s architecture
is based on bidirectional Transformer components, and remarkably, fine-tuning with an additional output layer achieves
outstanding performance across various downstream tasks. Bert stands as a milestone work in the history of NLP.
We give a summary of textual feature extraction models in Table 2, and conclude the visual and textual feature
extrctor distribution in Fig 3 to better show what the most used feature extraction methods are.
2.1.3 Improvement of Embedding. Numerous methods have been introduced for extracting embeddings of different
modalities. To adapt to more complex questions and generate more accurate answers, significant improvements have
been made in feature embedding, including Improving Visual Embedding [ 161,162], Adding Additional Information
[117, 253], and Improving Input Structure [218, 465]. We give the detailed improvement methods in Appendix. A.
2.2 Fusion Mechanism
2.2.1 Simple Vector Operations. Traditional fusion methods typically utilize simple vector operations like element-wise
addition, element-wise product, and vector concatenation to directly operate on visual features 𝑣𝐼and text features 𝑣𝑄
for generating joint representations. For element-wise addition and product, 𝑣𝐼and𝑣𝑄need to be related in the same
dimension. In cases where they are not, a linear projection [ 306] can be employed to embed these vectors into the same
space using transformation matrices 𝑊𝑣and𝑊𝑞. Vector connection splices 𝑣𝐼and𝑣𝑄together as fusion vector 𝑣𝐹.
In general, the use of element-wise addition does not increase extra computation, and is therefore a common feature
fusion method. In contrast, vector concatenation increases computational complexity significantly.
2.2.2 Deep Learning Method. The fusion of visual and textual features using deep learning can be categorized into
three main approaches: non-attentional deep learning, attention-based deep learning, and graph neural networks.
Non-Attention Based Deep Learning .CNNs and RNNs are commonly utilized for non-attention-based multimodal
fusion. Ren et al. [ 344] propose aligning image features 𝑣𝐼with word embeddings, feeding them into an LSTM model
alongside question words 𝑣𝑄𝑖. Ma et al. [ 285] leverage memory-augmented neural networks for visual question
answering (VQA), using memory modules to maintain longer-term information.
CNN-based approaches have also been explored. Ma et al. [ 287] proposed an end-to-end framework incorporating
image, sentence, and multimodal CNNs to enhance image-question interplay. Noh et al. [ 314] use a modified VGG-16
for image feature extraction and GRU for text, enabling adaptive parameter prediction. To preserve spatial information,
Gao et al. [ 115] introduce Question-Guided Hybrid Convolution, using question-guided kernels to learn discriminative
multimodal feature representations.
Bilinear pooling is widely employed for fine-grained visual recognition. Fukui et al. [ 107] introduce Multimodal
Compact Bilinear Pooling (MCB) to compress bilinear models, efficiently combining multimodal features. Schwartz et al.
[363] use MCB with attention mechanisms to capture high-order correlations, while Yu et al. [ 484] propose Multimodal
Factorization Bilinear (MFB) pooling for effective fusion, employing sum pooling to reduce dimensionality.
Attention Based Deep Learning .Based on the information in the question, there are parts of the image that are
more relevant to the question, which is also the part of the model that needs more attention. Therefore, the attention
mechanism is introduced into the multimodal fusion mechanism of VQA, and Figure 4 compares the non-attention and

attention-based deep learning methods. Li et al. [ 250] propose QRU, iteratively updating question representations based
on relevant image regions. Shih et al. [ 379] introduce edge boxes to obtain image regions, and selectively combine
image region features with text features, marking an early instance of attention-based deep learning methods in VQA. It
maps the region image features 𝑉=(𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣𝑚)and text features 𝑞to a common 𝑛-dimensional space, then calculates
the inner product between regions and question answers to determine relative weights.
Researches establish loose, global associations between questions and images. Zhu et al. [ 520] propose LSTM-Att to
establish semantic associations between image regions and text descriptions, capturing specific associations between
image-related questions and regions. Attention models have evolved to capture finer-grained associations. However, it
is not enough to only focus on local regions in visual features, and it is equally important to determine which words
need to be focused on in the problem. Lu et al. [ 275] introduce co-attention mechanisms to jointly perform visual and
question-guided attention. The joint attention is calculated as follows:
𝐶=𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑄𝑇𝑊𝑏𝑉), (1)
𝐻𝑣=𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑊𝑣𝑉+(𝑊𝑞𝑄)𝐶), (2)
𝐻𝑞=𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑊𝑞𝑄+(𝑊𝑣𝑉)𝐶𝑇), (3)
where𝑉is a visual feature, 𝑄is a text feature, 𝐶is co-attention, and 𝑊is the weight parameter.
Previous approaches mainly exploit low-level features while ignoring the rich semantics contained in high-level
features. Yu et al. [ 484] present a multi-level attention network to reduce the semantic gap and visual attention for
fine-grained spatial reasoning, aligning image regions and questions through feature multiplication for fine-grained
spatial reasoning. To further enhance multimodal fusion, Nguyen et al. [ 311] propose a symmetrical co-attention
mechanism, where each word in the question attends to image regions and vice versa. Wu et al. [ 438] addressed complex
reasoning tasks by introducing a chain of reasoning model, enabling dynamic relational reasoning between objects.
GNN-based Fusion Approaches .Traditional VQA methods often ignore the structural information in images or
questions. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for better feature fusion. Norcliffe et al. [ 315]
construct scene graphs conditioned on the question, using a 𝐾-kernel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture
Manuscript submitted to ACMNatural Language Understanding and Inference with MLLM in Visual Question Answering: A Survey 9
object interactions. Li et al. [ 245] propose Relation-Aware Graph Attention Networks (ReGAT), encoding semantic,
spatial, and implicit relations through attention mechanisms sensitive to node features and positional similarity:
𝛼𝑖𝑗=𝛼𝑏
𝑖𝑗exp((U𝑣′
𝑖)𝑇V𝑣′
𝑗)
Í
𝑗∈N(𝑖)𝛼𝑏
𝑖𝑗exp((U𝑣′
𝑖)𝑇V𝑣′
𝑗). (4)
For explicit relations, the attention mechanism accounts for edge labels and directions, allowing the model to capture
richer semantic dependencies.
In addition to image graphs, Teney et al. [ 406] construct a question graph based on the token syntactic relations. Sub-
sequently, a GRU-based GNN is deployed to aggregate first-order information, and a cross-modal attention mechanism
aligns textual tokens {𝑥′𝑄
𝑖}𝑁𝑄
𝑖=1from the question graph with visual objects {𝑥′𝑆
𝑖}𝑁𝑆
𝑖=1of the scene graph as follows:
𝛼𝑖𝑗=𝜎 
𝑊5 
𝑥′𝑄
𝑖
||𝑥′𝑄
𝑖||◦𝑥′𝑆

||𝑥′𝑆
𝑖||!
+𝑏5!
. (5)
Instead of using fully-connected graphs to represent images and questions, Huang et al. [ 160] prune edges in the
visual and question graphs based on the object overlapping region and syntactic dependencies respectively. In the
aggregation stage, a dual-channel graph convolutional network simultaneously captures relations between objects in
images and relations among textual tokens in questions.
Transforming questions into instructions to guide scene graph learning has garnered recent attention. Shi et al. [ 376]
propose using NLP tools to parse a given problem into a series of programs, and select different neural modules to
infer the scene graph according to the corresponding programs. Since the instructions represented by the program
set are finite and discontinuous, Hu et al. [ 156] parse questions into several textual instruction embeddings {𝑐𝑡}𝑇
𝑡=1
which are used to guide the process of message passing. In the procedure of scene graph learning, a GCN conditioned
on instruction embeddings dynamically predicts edge weights 𝑤(𝑡)
𝑗,𝑖to focus on different connections and aggregates
information from neighboring nodes ˜𝑥𝑗,𝑡to the target ˜𝑥𝑖,𝑡in each iteration. Liang et al. [ 259] regard VQA as an answer
generation task and propose a model LRTA consisting of four stages (Look, Read, Think, Answer). LRTA parses the
problem into instructions using a transformer-based framework and traverses the scene graph using a recursive neural
symbolic execution module that executes one instruction at each inference step.
2.2.3 Vision-Language Pre-training Models. Vision-Language Pre-training models are trained on large-scale unlabeled
data via self-supervision and fine-tuned for specific tasks, allowing for knowledge transfer and improved performance
with minimal labeled data. In multimodal research, methods fall into three categories: Dual-Stream, Single-Stream, and
other variants. Fig. 5 provide a comparison of Dual-Stream and Single-Stream.
Dual-Stream .The dual-stream paradigm in multimodal research involves processing visual and textual inputs
separately before integrating them through a cross-modal fusion module. Exemplifying this approach are ViLBERT
[276] and LXMERT [ 402]. ViLBERT extends the BERT architecture to a multimodal cross-stream model, employing
separate Transformers for visual and textual inputs and integrating them through a co-attention module. Similarly,
LXMERT introduces an architecture to learn the language-vision connection, utilizing object relationship encoders and
pre-training tasks to capture intra-modal and inter-modal relations.
In recent advancements, ERNIE-ViL [ 479] proposes integrating structured knowledge from scene graphs to enhance
semantic alignment. This model leverages the structured knowledge obtained from scene graphs to facilitate fine-grained
semantic understanding. Building upon previous research, Dou et al. [ 94] present the METER model, which refines

the dual-stream approach by stacking transformer layers with self-attention, co-attention, and feedforward networks.
METER conducts comprehensive experiments across various aspects of general pre-training models, providing insights
into the efficacy of different architectural components.
Single-Stream .Different from Dual-Stream approaches, Single-Stream models integrate textual and visual inputs
for semantic learning. Li et al. [ 235] propose Unicoder-VL, which matches specific text phrases with image features and
inputs them jointly into a multi-layer Transformer for cross-modal representation learning. They introduce a formulation
to combine text and image features, leveraging both region and location information. To mitigate overfitting with limited
target tasks, Su et al. [ 395] train VL-BERT on large-scale image description and plain text datasets simultaneously,
enabling the learning of more general feature representations. Their model employs stacked multi-layer Transformer
modules to adaptively aggregate information from different modalities.
Chen et al. [ 60] propose UNITER, a general image-text representation learning model that conducts fine-grained
semantic alignment between words and image regions. They introduce a novel pre-training task with conditional
masking, enhancing the alignment process. Meanwhile, Kim et al. [ 193] present ViLT, a lightweight model focused on
modal interactions without relying on region or deep convolutional features. Instead, they use a pre-trained Vision
Transformer (ViT) to extract visual features. In Single-Stream models, it’s impractical to encapsulate intra-modal and
vision-language learning in the same Transformer. Xue et al. [ 455] introduce self-attention to the visual domain to
facilitate learning visual modalities. They utilize Swin Transformer [ 272] to obtain visual feature embeddings and
perform visual masking based on internal attention scores from the inter-modal Transformer.
Previous pre-trained models rely heavily on the image feature extraction process (such as Faster R-CNN [ 346]
and ResNet [ 139]), requiring high hardware equipment and time-consuming training. Kim et al. [ 193] propose the
lightweight model ViLT, the main computation of which is concentrated on the modal interactions. ViLT does not use
region features or deep convolutional features but uses a pre-trained ViT model [93] to extract visual features.

Variants and Improvements in Vision-Language Pre-training Approaches .There are some variants and
improvements in training techniques, with the detailed introduction in Appendix. B.
Early methods such as ViLBERT [ 277] employ task-specific networks for vision-language multi-task learning. Lu et
al. introduced a shared backbone with task-specific layers for each task, optimizing model parameters across different
vision-language tasks.To enhance model robustness, adversarial learning was applied to vision-language pre-training
by Gan et al. [ 108], who proposed the VILLA framework. This method introduces adversarial noise into the image and
word embedding spaces, improving model generalization. Contrastive learning is introduced in the multimodal domain
by Li et al. [ 251]. UNIMO leverages a three-stream architecture to process language, visual, and cross-modal fusion
independently, optimizing representations for both single- and multi-modal tasks. The objective function involves
maximizing the similarity between positive pairs of image and text embeddings:
E𝑉,𝑊[−logexp(𝑑(𝑉+,𝑊+)/𝜏)Í
Xexp(𝑑(𝑉′,𝑊′)/𝜏)]. (8)
Radford et al. [ 341] introduced CLIP, a significant step forward in learning image-text relationships through contrastive
learning. CLIP normalizes word and region embeddings and computes their similarity via dot product, learning robust
representations for zero-shot vision-language tasks, where 𝐼𝑒and𝑇𝑒represent the joint multimodal features:
𝐼𝑒=𝐿2𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝐼𝑓,𝑊𝑖), 𝑇𝑒=𝐿2𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑇𝑓,𝑊𝑡). (9)
Li et al. [ 240] further improved vision-language models with ALBEF, which leverages momentum distillation to
align image-text pairs and combat noisy data, introducing image-text contrastive loss. Recent models like BLIP [ 241]
and PNP-VQA [ 411] have further extended this line of work by integrating multimodal generation and understanding
within a unified framework, demonstrating strong performance in zero-shot VQA tasks.
These vision-language pre-training methods have not only bridged the gap between vision and language under-
standing in VQA but have also become essential for aligning visual and textual information. This alignment serves as a
foundational element for transitioning from purely text-based Large Language Models to multimodal Large Language
Models.
3 COMPREHENSION OF IMAGE AND TEXT WITH LLMS IN ZERO-SHOT VQA
As text large language models (LLMs) have shown amazing performance in multiple textual tasks and attracted great
attention from the whole community, more and more research attempts have been made to explore the introduction of
LLMS into other domains [ 14]. However, LLMs cannot directly process image information, so there is a rising need for
generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to accomplish various multimodal tasks [204].
3.1 LLM Aided Visual Understanding
Since Large Language Models (LLMs) are text-based, early Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) explore
leveraging LLMs as central controllers for multimodal tasks [ 131]. LLMs act as a central controller that (1) analyze
the prompt and history of dialogues, (2) split a complex task into simpler sub-tasks and (3) assign these tasks to
appropriate models. Fig.6 shows the LLM aided visual understanding models. For instance, Microsoft Visual ChatGPT
[441] integrates LLMs with various Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) (e.g., BLIP [ 241], Stable Diffusion, ControlNet),
using a Prompt Manager to manage input/output formats. The LLM analyzes prompts, divides tasks, and invokes VFMs

to generate outputs. Additionally, Visual ChatGPT utilizes dialogue history management and iterative reasoning to
invoke further VFMs for more accurate results.
MM-REACT [ 471] focuses on broader visual interpretation by incorporating Azure APIs for tasks like celebrity
recognition and Bing search. This enhances the LLM’s role as a controller for visual understanding and interaction. As
tasks grow more complex, LLMs evolve into decision-makers, as in IdealGPT [ 478], where autonomous agents handle
complex tasks. These agents consist of modules for profiling, memory, planning, and action [ 373], allowing the LLM to
understand dynamic environments and organize responses effectively.
3.2 Image to Text Generation for Visual Understanding
For the issue that textual large language models cannot process images, another inspiration is to transform images
directly into corresponding textual descriptions [ 469], as shown in Fig.7. This typically involves models like Image
Captioning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) [ 393]. For example, PICA [ 469] uses image captioning to generate
textual descriptions, which are concatenated with questions and fed into the LLM for question answering. To improve
In-context Learning, PICA selects 16 training examples closest to the current test image-question pair using CLIP [ 341].
However, converting images into text can lead to inaccuracies or loss of essential visual details. To address this,
IMG2LLM [ 129] generates more relevant captions and question-answer examples directly from the image. This model
focuses on selecting image regions pertinent to the question and refining the captions for accuracy. It also synthesizes
question-answer pairs to provide more representative in-context prompts. Prophet [ 367] enhances the selection of
in-context examples and the generation of answer heuristics for VQA tasks. Prophet uses a Vanilla VQA [ 174] model to
generate answer candidates, which serve as examples. These answer-aware heuristics, along with the testing samples,
are input into the LLM as prompts, improving VQA performance.
3.3 General Multimodal LLM
LLM-aided visual understanding and image-to-text generation methods demonstrate the ability to leverage pure-
text LLMs for multimodal tasks. However, these approaches do not inherently grant LLMs image comprehension
capabilities. Instead, LLMs either rely on visual foundation models for image processing or convert images into textual

representations. To address this, there is growing interest in developing general-purpose MLLMs with direct image
comprehension abilities by integrating additional modalities into a unified framework, as shown in Fig. 7.
3.3.1 The Training Paradigm of General Multimodal LLM. The training architecture for general multimodal LLMs,
typically using frozen LLMs, follows a two-stage process, as shown in Fig 7. First, the LLM is frozen while external
components, such as visual encoders and alignment modules, are trained to map image features into the textual space
of the LLM [ 426]. In the second stage, the visual components are frozen, and the LLM is fine-tuned with multimodal
data, often using techniques like LoRA or Q-LoRA [ 84]. This method significantly reduces the cost of extending LLMs
to multimodal tasks, with a focus on designing effective image-to-text alignment modules, instead of training a new
multimodal large model. Thus, it plays a pivotal role in the advancement of MLLMs, with the core challenge of designing
more effective Image-to-Text alignment modules.
3.3.2 Image-to-Text Alignment in Multimodal LLM. Flamingo [ 14] introduces a vision encoder and a Perceiver Resampler
to generate a fixed-length feature sequence, integrated with cross-attention layers for improved visual-textual alignment.
PaLM-E [ 96] integrates visual features into the pre-trained PaLM model, leading to robust performance across real-world
tasks, a method adopted by models like LLaVA [ 269] and Shikra [ 56]. However, freezing the LLM during training can
limit alignment effectiveness. BLIP-2 [ 242] addresses this by proposing the Q-Former, using a two-stage pre-training
approach where the visual encoder learns critical visual features through contrastive learning and image-text matching.
This method enhances zero-shot capabilities, though it shows limited in-context learning improvements.
To reduce computational demands, smaller and faster models like PaLI-3 [ 58], based on SigLIP [ 494], offer competitive
performance across multimodal benchmarks while requiring fewer resources.
3.3.3 Advanced Closed and Open-source General MLLMs. As MLLM continues to develop, researchers continue to
expand the data and parameter scale for MLLM pre-training, and continue pre-training, hoping to teach MLLM more
and more new general knowledge and make it more powerful. In this context, the development of MLLM is no longer
based on the improvement of VQA, a downstream task, but more focused on its general capabilities and performance in
multiple tasks in the entire multimodal field. Many commercial models have emerged, such as OpenAI’s GPT series,

including GPT-4v with image and text interleaving processing capabilities [ 61], and GPT-4o frameworks with more
powerful multimodal general capabilities and support for more multimodal inputs [ 168], such as Google’s Genimi and
Gemini Pro series [405].
In parallel, the open-source community has developed several high-performing models that rival, and in some cases
surpass, these commercial counterparts. The mPLUG series [475], for example, has been praised for its versatile
cross-modal capabilities. mPLUG-OWL excels in open-world vision-language tasks, benefiting from its ability to
handle a wide range of image-text pairs and unstructured data sources. The InternVL series , such as InternVL-2 or
InternLM-XComposer2.5-VL[ 62], distinguishes itself by focusing on improving vision-language alignment through
sophisticated pre-training techniques, allowing for highly effective cross-modal understanding. which has proven
especially effective in sophisticated tasks like math reasoning. Similarly, the LLaVA series [270] has garnered attention
for its innovative approach to integrating large-scale vision-language models. Through a carefully curated combination
of instruction tuning and multimodal dialogue datasets, the LLaVa series has achieved strong performance in both
visual comprehension and interactive reasoning.
3.4 Techniques of the MLLMs
We summarize the recent MLLM models with their base LLM models, MLLM types, Techniques and Performances in
Table 3. There are various techniques that have helped the researchers in generalizing LLM to MLLM, which equip the
LLM with the image understanding capability.
Fine-tuning and Instruction-tuning. Fine-tuning enhances MLLM’s ability to interpret input images and questions
[169,360,433]. Typically, a VQA prompt includes: (1) task background description, (2) input context (image, image
description, OCR), (3) the target question and answer candidates, and (4) reference answers [ 54,129,519]. The prompt
design varies across models. For instance, Visual ChatGPT [ 441] incorporates multiple visual model formats, while
Manuscript submitted to ACMNatural Language Understanding and Inference with MLLM in Visual Question Answering: A Survey 15
domain-specific VQA may include specialized background knowledge or pre-labeled visual prompts for object detection
and segmentation tasks [460].
Fine-tuning with specific datasets helps MLLM perform specialized tasks. For example, general MLLMs struggle with
mathematical reasoning [ 282], so tailored datasets for diagram understanding [ 502], geometry reasoning [ 257], and
handwritten equation recognition [ 326] have been created to improve performance. To avoid losing general capabilities,
fine-tuning often involves both task-specific and general datasets.
In-context Learning. To improve few-shot or zero-shot learning in VQA, researchers leverage in-context learning (ICL),
which uses example contexts to enhance LLM performance [ 91,130,373]. Early ICL prompts were textual, selecting
image-question pairs similar to the target [ 94,283,367], while more recent approaches generate examples directly
from the target image itself [ 129]. Multimodal ICL integrates additional visual context, beyond text, to aid learning
[284,504]. Current research explores two key aspects: (1) improving example selection for better task understanding,
with methods like RAG utilizing retrieval and generation to create more representative examples [ 367,414,469]; and
(2) designing richer multimodal context schemas, such as MMICL, which generates subgraphs of target images with
symbolic correspondences to textual elements [283, 504].
Visual Perception Capability. Early studies directly extend LLM to equip with visual functions and choose to call basic
visual models, such as Object Detection, Image Captioning, and OCR, to provide usable visual information for plain text
LLM [ 367,469]. Further, researchers explored directly giving LLM visual understanding capabilities. By designing a
visual encoder adapted to LLM, the ability to match images and texts is pre-trained in a large amount of image and text
data [ 77,233,242]. The general MLLM achieves pixel-level image understanding based on image encoders such as visual
Transformer. Compared with the previous MLLM based on object-level image understanding, it has better image-text
alignment and fine-grained understanding capabilities [ 270]. Based on this training, MLLM enhances the semantic
segmentation capability of images through better visual annotation [ 441], and combines multiple and larger image
data to train MLLM to understand more diverse images [ 475]. However, since a large amount of training data comes
from natural images in real scenes, MLLM exposes its defects in understanding specific images, such as understanding
document images such as PDF (especially formulas in images) [ 88], understanding related text and symbols in real
scenes [256], and understanding complex charts [493]. More real-scene OCR technologies are being explored.
4 KNOWLEDGE REASONING IN VQA
4.1 Knowldege Sources
External knowledge is indispensable for knowledge-based VQA task whose answers cannot be readily inferred from
images but requires common sense knowledge. We summarize the most widely used knowledge sources for recent
knowledge-based VQA methods, which can be divided into two categories based on the data format, structured
knowledge such as DBpedia [ 27] and ConceptNet [ 271], and unstructured knowledge [ 87,249]. We give detailed
introduction of the knowledge sources in Appendix. C., and conclude the different knowledge source in models in Table
4.
4.2 Knowledge Extraction
4.2.1 Entity-based Extraction. Entity-based methods extract visual or textual concepts from image-question pairs,
using them as anchors for knowledge extraction. For instance, Wu et al. [ 444] extract key attributes from images and

generate SPARQL queries for DBpedia retrieval. Similarly, Wang et al. [ 423] detect visual concepts (objects, attributes,
scenes) and link them to synonymous entities in DBpedia to construct RDF graphs. To enhance extraction, Su et al.
[396] apply subgraph hashing to match knowledge triplets with question phrases and expand relevant connections.
Recently, Li et al. [ 237] introduced an approach that treats visual and textual concepts as KG anchors, expanding to
include first-order neighbors and scoring nodes to select relevant knowledge.
4.2.2 Feature-based Extraction. Feature-based methods focus on converting knowledge into continuous representations.
Narasimhan et al. [ 307] use LSTMs to extract key relations from questions and calculate affinity scores between the
image-question features and knowledge base facts, selecting the most relevant knowledge. Ziaeefard et al. [ 525] further
develop this by transforming facts into semi-phrases, which are represented using BERT. Ding et al. [ 87] merge
knowledge extraction with image-question feature extraction through a pre-trained visual-linguistic model. Li et al.
[248] view knowledge extraction as graph representation learning, linking images to captions and KGs, and using
Deepwalk to generate knowledge-aware embeddings. More details about the knowledge extraction methods can be
found in Appendix. D.
4.3 Knowledge Reasoning
Knowledge reasoning in knowledge-based VQA involves deriving answers from extracted knowledge [372].
4.3.1 Conventional Reasoning Methods. Conventional methods often employ rule-based or template-based approaches.
Wang et al. [ 423] extract visual concepts from images and parse questions using templates to generate SPARQL queries
for answer reasoning. Wang et al. [ 424] take this further by using LSTMs to parse questions into KB query triplets,
filtering concepts and relations from both the image and the knowledge base, and applying distinct rules based on the
source of the knowledge.
4.3.2 One-Hop Reasoning Methods. Methods based on conventional reasoning are usually unstable under complex
conditions and unscalable to different domains. One-hop reasoning methods utilize deep learning to solve these problems
from first-order knowledge, where latent rules are learned for fact selection in training.
As for structured knowledge, Wu et al. [ 444] proposed an encoder-decoder answer generation architecture. They
first generate SPARQL queries based on an image for KB searching. Then, collected knowledge comment paragraphs
Manuscript submitted to ACMNatural Language Understanding and Inference with MLLM in Visual Question Answering: A Survey 17
are combined together and sent to Doc2Vec [ 221] to get the knowledge feature. Finally, knowledge and image features
are combined with question tokens, which are sequentially fed into an encoder-decoder LSTM framework to get the
answer. Narasimhan et al. [ 308] treat answer reasoning as the combination of fact scoring and source scoring. They first
extract the image feature, visual caption feature, and question feature, and utilize a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) to fuse
these features into an image-question representation 𝑔𝑀𝐿𝑃𝑤1(𝑥,𝑄). Then, they leverage 𝑔𝑀𝐿𝑃𝑤1(𝑥,𝑄)to score vectorized
external knowledge 𝑔𝐹(𝑓𝑖), and choose the most relevant fact as the candidate answer ˆ𝑓:
𝑆𝑤1(𝑔𝐹(𝑓𝑖),𝑔𝑀𝐿𝑃
𝑤1(𝑥,𝑄))=𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑔𝐹(𝑓𝑖),𝑔𝑀𝐿𝑃
𝑤1(𝑥,𝑄))
=𝑔𝐹(𝑓𝑖)·𝑔𝑀𝐿𝑃𝑤1(𝑥,𝑄)𝑔𝐹(𝑓𝑖)·𝑔𝑀𝐿𝑃𝑤1(𝑥,𝑄)).(10)
Finally, the problem 𝑄is sent into an LSTM to predict the answer source ˆ𝑠=ℎ𝑠𝑤2(𝑄), where ˆ𝑠∈{𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒,𝐾𝐵}. If
ˆ𝑠=𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑒 , the head entity of ˆ𝑓is taken as the answer, and vice versa.
Qu et al. [ 338] take the idea of Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) [ 184] and propose a coarse-grained approach for
outside-knowledge-based VQA, that is, finding several passages containing answers as output. They use a BERT to
extract the passage representations of candidate collection before the training process and store them in the memory
slot to reduce redundant computations. To further merge the visual problem information, the given image and question
are simultaneously fed into a pre-trained visual language model LXMERT [ 402] to obtain a query representation. The
dot products of query representation and passage representations are calculated to obtain the top- 𝑘passages.
Since coarse-grained passages only provide texts that may contain an answer but not the answer itself, Gao et al.
[109] take candidate passages as their external knowledge, and deploy a generative model for answer reasoning. To
enhance multimodal compatibility, they first utilize the combination of caption text 𝐶𝑖, attribute text 𝐿𝑖, and optical
character recognition (OCR) text 𝑂𝑖to represent the given image 𝑣𝑖=(𝐶𝑖,𝐿𝑖,𝑂𝑖). Then, each candidate passages 𝑝𝑖,𝑘of
top-𝑘collections are concatenated with question context 𝑄𝑖and image context 𝑣𝑖to a Transformer-based encoder to
get𝑘hidden layer representations:
z𝑄𝑖=(z𝑄𝑖
1,z𝑄𝑖
2,···,z𝑄𝑖
𝑘), (11)
z𝑄𝑖
𝑘=𝐸𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑓𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑛(𝑄𝑖,𝑣𝑖,𝑝𝑖,𝑘). (12)
Finally, these representations are sent to a decoder to generate the answer, and an auto-regressive cross-entropy loss
is used to train the entire model.
𝑃(𝑎1),...,𝑃(𝑎1)=𝜎(𝐷𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑓𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑛(z𝑄𝑖)). (13)
4.3.3 Multi-Hop Reasoning Methods. One-hop reasoning methods typically extract shallow knowledge from the KB
and are incapable of exploiting implicit knowledge and handling inter-fact relations. To solve these problems, multi-hop
reasoning has been widely used in recent methods, which refers to performing multi-step inference on the KB to explore
the logical and semantic relations between facts. There are three main branches of multi-hop reasoning: memory-based
reasoning, graph-based reasoning, and implicit reasoning.
Memory-based Reasoning .Memory-based methods treat reasoning as the process of knowledge memory. These
methods iteratively memorize candidate facts to extract relevant knowledge and ignore extraneous knowledge, which
brings the capacity of multi-hop reasoning.
Li et al. [ 236] first filter the extracted knowledge, where facts are scored based on the knowledge graph topology
and the top- 𝑁facts are selected as candidates. Then, the representations of candidate facts are extracted and stored in
Manuscript submitted to ACM18 Kuang and Xie, et al.
memory slots for reading and writing. In the next process, they deploy a dynamic memory network with 𝑇iterations for
knowledge accumulation, which consists of an attention component and a memory updating component. The attention
component assigns weights for each knowledge representation 𝑀𝑖:
𝛼(𝑡)=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(w𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(W2z(𝑡)
𝑖+b2)),
z(𝑡)
𝑖=[𝑀𝑖;𝑚(𝑡−1);q],
q=𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(W1[f(𝐼);f(𝑄);f(𝐴)]+b1),(14)
in which f(𝐼),f(𝑄),f(𝐴)are features of images, questions, and multi-choice answers respectively. The memory updating
component accumulates knowledge based on attention weights to update the memory vector 𝑚(𝑡):
𝑚(𝑡)=𝑅𝐸𝐿𝑈(W3[𝑚(𝑡−1);c(𝑡);q]+b3),
c(𝑡)=𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝛼(𝑡)𝑀𝑖,𝑡=1,...,𝑇.(15)
Finally, f(𝐼),f(𝑄),f(𝐴)and𝑚(𝑇)are fused together to obtain the confidence score for each candidate answer.
Instead of directly considering each fact as an entirety, Su et al. [ 396] use key-value structural memory slots. They
first decompose each knowledge triplet (𝑠,𝑟,𝑡)into three key-value pairs (i.e., (𝑠,𝑟)-𝑡,(𝑠,𝑡)-𝑟,(𝑟,𝑡)-𝑠), which are passed
to the joint embedding module to get the key representation k𝑖and value representation v𝑖:
k𝑖=Ψ(𝑒1,𝑢𝑖)+Ψ(𝑒2,𝑢𝑖),v𝑖=Ψ(𝑒3,𝑢𝑖), (16)
where𝑒1,𝑒2,𝑒3are different entries of 𝑖-th triplet, and 𝑢𝑖is the image feature. Then, a memory network iteratively
refines the memory vector by performing key addressing and value addressing to obtain the answer. Li et al. [ 247] store
all entries of each knowledge triplet in a value slot (i.e., [𝐹𝑠,𝐹𝑟,𝐹𝑡]) and take their average representation as the key
embedding. Then, a memory reading module captures the correlation between query embedding ˆ𝑞and key-value pairs
(ˆ𝑘𝑖-ˆ𝑣𝑖) and obtains the question-aware knowledge representation 𝑚𝑡which is further used to guide the graph learning:
𝑚𝑡=𝑁∑︁
𝑖=1𝑝𝑖ˆ𝑣𝑖,
𝑝𝑖=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(ˆ𝑞·ˆ𝑘𝑇
𝑖),
ˆ𝑣𝑖=∑︁
ˆ𝑣𝑖𝑗∈[𝐹𝑠,𝐹𝑟,𝐹𝑡](1−𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(ˆ𝑞·ˆ𝑣𝑇
𝑖𝑗))ˆ𝑣𝑖𝑗/2.(17)
Graph-based Reasoning .Graph-based methods tend to represent extracted facts as graphs, and then use the
message passing paradigm to aggregate knowledge from multi-hop neighborhoods to the target nodes. This process
enables the model to explicitly exploit the attribute information and relational information embedded in the KB, which
is the most commonly used multi-hop reasoning method for the knowledge-based VQA task.
Narasimhan et al. [ 308] propose a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model for graph-based reasoning,
which mainly consists of two components: the factual graph construction and answer scoring. For the factual graph
construction, facts fetched from the KB are composed into a homogeneous graph, where each node represents an entity,
and each edge represents a relation. For incorporating images and questions information, the representation of each
Manuscript submitted to ACMNatural Language Understanding and Inference with MLLM in Visual Question Answering: A Survey 19
node is formed by the concatenation of image feature 𝑔𝑉𝑤(𝐼), question feature 𝑔𝑄
𝑤(𝑄)and entity feature 𝑔𝐶𝑤(𝑒):
𝐻0
𝑖=(𝑔𝑉
𝑤(𝐼);𝑔𝑄
𝑤(𝑄);𝑔𝐶
𝑤(𝑒)), 𝑒𝑖∈𝐸, (18)
where𝐸is the entity set. In the process of answer scoring, a GCN integrates node features based on graph topology and
outputs the 𝐿-th layer features ˆ𝑔(𝑒𝑖)=𝐻𝐿
𝑖which are fed into an MLP to predict answer ˆ𝐴:
ˆ𝐴=arg max
𝑒𝑖∈𝐸𝑀𝐿𝑃(ˆ𝑔(𝑒𝑖)). (19)
In addition to using graph structure to represent the structural relationships between facts, Zhu et al. [ 522] further
introduce visual graphs and semantic graphs to comprehensively depict image information. The visual graph is a scene
graph, which is composed of objects in the given image and their positional relations. As for the semantic graph, an
image is first sent to the DenseCap [ 179] to generate several captions, which are parsed into a semantic graph. The
knowledge reasoning of this model comprises two parts: intra-modal knowledge selection and inter-modal knowledge
reasoning. In the first stage, the visual, semantic, and factual graphs are aggregated separately using different GCNs to
obtain the updated node features: {ˆ𝑣𝑉
𝑖}𝑁𝑉
𝑖=1,{ˆ𝑣𝑆
𝑖}𝑁𝑆
𝑖=1,{ˆ𝑣𝐹
𝑖}𝑁𝐹
𝑖=1respectively. In the second stage, the information on the
visual and semantic graphs is mapped to the factual graph (i.e., visual-to-factual and semantic-to-factual). Taking the
semantic-to-factual process as an example:
𝑚𝑆→𝐹
𝑖=∑︁
𝑗∈𝑁𝑉Υ𝑆→𝐹
𝑗𝑖ˆ𝑣𝑆
𝑗,
Υ𝑆→𝐹
𝑗𝑖=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑤𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑊8ˆ𝑣𝑆
𝑗+𝑊9[ˆ𝑣𝐹
𝑖,𝑞])),(20)
in which Υ𝑆→𝐹
𝑗𝑖is the attention vector between ˆ𝑣𝐹
𝑖and each node of semantic graph, and 𝑚𝑆→𝐹
𝑖is the weighted sum of
nodes on semantic graph for ˆ𝑣𝐹
𝑖. Finally,𝑚𝑆→𝐹
𝑖,𝑚𝑉→𝐹
𝑖,ˆ𝑣𝐹
𝑖are fed into an element-wise gate network to get the final
representation ˜𝑣𝐹
𝑖:
˜𝑣𝐹
𝑖=𝑊11(𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖◦[𝑚𝑆→𝐹

𝑖;ˆ𝑣𝐹
𝑖]),
𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑖=𝜎(𝑊10[𝑚𝑆→𝐹
𝑖;𝑚𝑉→𝐹
𝑖;ˆ𝑣𝐹
𝑖]).(21)
Li et al. [ 237] treat knowledge reasoning as a process of anchor entity feature learning, where anchor entities could
continuously acquire knowledge from the KB and facilitate answer prediction. They first use an object detector and a
natural language parsing tool to extract entities from images, questions and candidate answers as anchor entities. In
the second process, the first-order neighbors of anchor entities are obtained from the KB to form a global knowledge
graph, which is fed into the attention-based GNN for feature aggregation. Then, extracted knowledge is distilled into
three auxiliary features ®𝑒(𝑐𝑡𝑥),®𝑢,®𝑒(𝑎𝑛𝑠):
®𝑒(𝑐𝑡𝑥)=∑︁
𝑒𝑖∈C𝛼𝑖®𝑒𝑖,®𝑢=𝑅𝐸𝐿𝑈(𝛽·𝑊3),®𝑒(𝑎𝑛𝑠)=∑︁
𝑒𝑗∈A𝛽𝑗®𝑒𝑗, (22)
where𝛼𝑖∝𝑒𝑥𝑝(ℎ𝑞·®𝑒𝑖), 𝛽𝑗∝𝑒𝑥𝑝(®𝑒(𝑐𝑡𝑥)·®𝑒𝑗), (23)
in whichℎ𝑞is the query embedding, Cis the anchor entity set extracted from the question and image, and Ais the
anchor entity set extracted from candidate answers. Finally, auxiliary features are fused with image feature ˜𝑣𝑘andℎ𝑞:
®𝑓=𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒𝐹𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛({˜𝑣𝑘};{®𝑒(𝑐𝑡𝑥),®𝑒(𝑎𝑛𝑠),®𝑢}∪{ℎ𝑞

Implicit Reasoning .Different from memory-based or graph-based methods, implicit reasoning treats the multi-hop
reasoning task as an entity feature space learning issue, which aims to map the head, relation, and tail entities into a
common feature space such that they can establish some statistical associations.
Ramnath et al. [ 342] proposed the “See is Knowing” framework, where the visual information is represented as
several knowledge vectors to facilitate answer prediction. They first deploy an ERMLP model [ 92] on the large-scale
KG, which captures the intrinsic connections between entities by learning to identify whether given facts exist. ERMLP
can implicitly perform multi-hop reasoning in learning and generate a dense embedding for each entity. Then, scene,
object, and action concepts are detected in given images and passed to ERMLP to get their knowledge-aware embedding
𝑒𝑗
𝑖,𝑗∈[1,𝑚]. Finally, these visual knowledge embeddings and the query embedding 𝐴(𝑞𝑖)are passed into an attention
module:
𝐴(𝐼𝑖)=𝑚∑︁
𝑗=1𝛼𝑗
𝐼𝑒𝑗
𝑖,𝛼𝑗
𝐼=𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑤𝑇𝛼𝐼[𝐴(𝑞𝑖);𝑒𝑗
𝑖])
Í𝑚
𝑘=1𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑤𝑇𝛼𝐼[𝐴(𝑞𝑖);𝑒𝑘
𝑖]), (25)
in which𝐴(𝐼𝑖),𝐴(𝑞𝑖)are further used to query the answer from the KG.
As facts on the KG are typically rigid and incapable of complex scene understanding, Ding et al. [ 87] propose MuKEA,
which extracts and accumulates complex knowledge from VQA scenarios directly. They consider the model learning
process as a multimodal knowledge graph completion problem, i.e., extracting multimodal knowledge triplets from
image-question pairs and training the model taking the idea of TransE [ 39]. During the head entity extraction, a
pre-trained visual-language model LXMERT [ 402] is used to obtain the image embeddings and question embeddings
jointly. These embeddings are fed into a hard attention mechanism, which captures the correlations between each
object and question token to get the head entity. During tail entity extraction, the answer representation is used as the
tail embedding. This implicit reasoning allows the model to continuously acquire multimodal knowledge from the VQA
dataset and fully exploit potential clues between facts.
4.4 MULTIMODAL REASONING WITH LLMs
Recent years have witnessed the remarkable progress of MLLMs, especially in their surprising zero/few-shot reasoning
abilities. In varieties of multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g., VQA), MLLMs often demonstrate impressive effectiveness.
Therefore, MLLMs and VQA task run towards each other at the same time, forging a new direction for VQA research.
Specifically, MLLMs are capable to make great comprehension and integration of information from image and textual
questions after pretraining on large-scale multimodal data, enabling them to reason carefully and generate appropriate
answers. Furthermore, several strategies have recently emerged to enhance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs and
improve the VQA performance, such as multimodal instruction tuning [ 77], multimodal in-context learning [ 14],
multimodal chain-of-thought [283], and LLM-aided visual reasoning [373].
4.4.1 Multimodal Instruction Tuning. Pretrained MLLMs often struggle with generalizing to novel tasks and aligning
with users’ intentions, resulting in incorrect and dissatisfactory responses. To address these limitations, a strategy
known as multimodal instruction tuning (M-IT) [ 360] has been introduced. Instruction refers to the task description.
Multimodal instruction tuning is a technique that involves finetuning pretrained MLLMs on a collection of multimodal
instruction-following data. Tuning in this way, MLLMs are guided to understand and adapt to the task of interest, thus
boosting their zero-shot reasoning capabilities and task-specific performance. The success of some notable frameworks
on VQA (e.g., BLIP-2 [242]) validates the effectiveness of this idea.
Manuscript submitted to ACMNatural Language Understanding and Inference with MLLM in Visual Question Answering: A Survey 21
4.4.2 Multimodal In-Context Learning. As the demand for customized MLLMs for specific VQA task continues to grow,
finetuning them by instruction tuning proves to be resource-intensive and may diminish the model’s generalization
capabilities. Furthermore, state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4V are primarily accessible only through API calls, with
their parametric weights remaining proprietary and unavailable to the public. This scenario underscores the growing
need for a new methodology, multimodal in-context learning (M-ICL), which allow learning from analogy [ 90] without
requiring parametric updates. Specifically in M-ICL, MLLMs learn from a few examples noted as demonstration. The
examples not only provide supplementary contextual knowledge for MLLMs but also exert flexible control over output,
thereby solving complex and unseen tasks in a few-shot manner [ 470]. Researches in M-ICL [ 14,468] are shown
empirically to enhance the reasoning ability of MLLMs on VQA tasks.
4.4.3 Multimodal Chain-of-Thought. In recent studies, chain-of-thought has gained widespread usage in eliciting the
multi-step reasoning abilities of LLMs. Specifically, CoT aims to enable LLMs to imitate the step-by-step thinking
process of humans. It encourages the LLMs to generate not only the final answer but also the intermediate reasoning
chains that lead to the answer by adding a prompt like “Let’s think step by step”. Subsequently, to extend CoT reasoning
to multimodality, several works [ 146,350] have been proposed to extend the unimodal CoT to Multimodal CoT (M-CoT).
Given the inputs in different modalities, Multimodal CoT decomposes multi-step problems into intermediate reasoning
steps (rationale) and then infers the answer. The success of multiple researches [ 281,503] validates the effectiveness of
M-CoT in enhancing MLLMs reasoning ability in VQA tasks.
4.4.4 LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning. Building on the achievements of tool-augmented LLMs [ 323], researchers have
explored the potential of invoking external tools and modular approaches for visual reasoning tasks like VQA. Specifically,
vision foundation models [ 440] like image captioning and optical character recognition are usually invoked for better
visual information understanding. Invoking external tools [ 283] such as knowledge retrieval and web search engines
help LLMs access real-time information and leverage domain-specific knowledge from external resources. Multiple
researches [ 373,464] indicate that effective utilization of external tools enables LLMs to accommodate various reasoning
capabilities for accomplishing complex VQA tasks.
4.4.5 Math and Logical Reasoning. MLLMs are increasingly being applied to mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
The core challenge is that solving math and logic problems requires not only linguistic understanding but also a deeper
ability to perform structured reasoning, abstract thinking, and accurate computation, all of which pose limitations for
traditional language models [282, 448].
To address this, various methods have been explored. One prevalent approach is symbolic manipulation, where
MLLMs are trained to recognize symbolic representations of mathematical expressions (e.g., formulas, diagrams) and
perform algebraic transformations [ 254,446]. These models integrate visual features from images or written equations
with text-based inputs, allowing for more nuanced reasoning in both spatial and symbolic contexts. There are some
attempts that try to improve the visual ability for math diagrams or logical charts [ 502], to explore the potential math
and logical reasoning performance. Another key method is chain of thought reasoning [ 177,220]. In this approach,
models learn to extract symbolic rules from data and apply them within a structured reasoning framework. This
enables them to handle tasks that require step-by-step deduction, such as proofs or multi-step logical arguments. Recent
advancements also involve the multi-agent systems to integrate external symbolic solvers, where MLLMs collaborate
with dedicated math engines (e.g., Wolfram Alpha) to perform complex calculations or proofs, improving accuracy for
higher-level reasoning tasks.

5 DATASETS AND METRICS
5.1 Datasets
In this part, we systematically summarize the most widely used VQA datasets that are divided into two categories: (1)
datasets whose questions are typically based on common sense knowledge (Sec 5.1.1). (2) datasets based on external
knowledge (Sec 5.1.2). The statistics of all datasets are listed in Table 5, and we conclude the seven most widely-used
dataset in Fig. 8. Some representative datasets are selected to be presented here, and the rest are shown in Appendix. E.
5.1.1 Datasets without External Knowledge.
DAQUAR [289].DAQUAR is the first proposed VQA challenge. It is built on the NYU-Depth v2 [ 381] dataset, which
contains 1,449 images and 12,468 Q&A pairs. Its annotation generation methods include synthetic and human. The
synthetic annotation uses eight predefined templates and the original annotation of NYU-Depth v2. Human annotations
come from 5 in-house participants. Although the proposal of DAQUAR is important to VQA, it also has some problems.
For instance, the magnitude of images is too small; the image quality is poor and disorganized; the dataset is unbalanced;
there are too many single-choice questions.
VQAv1 [23].VQAv1 is one of the most widely used datasets, which contains 204,721 real images from the COCO
dataset (123,287 images for training and 81,434 images for testing). It covers 614,163 free-form questions and 7,984,119
answers, allowing yes/no, multiple-choice, and open-ended forms of questions. These questions are collected by humans,
and each question is manually annotated by 10 different people. The annotations also include the answers given by
humans without looking at the images.
VQAv2 [123].VQAv2 is the enhanced version of the VQAv1 dataset, which contains 204,721 images sourced from the
COCO dataset. It has 443,757, 214,354, and 447,793 question annotations on the training set, validation set, and test set,
respectively. VQAv2 has a total of 1,105,904 free-form Q&A pairs annotated by humans, twice as many as VQAv1, and
provides a complementary image for each question so that the same question can be combined with two similar images

to generate different answers. Compared with VQAv1, VQAv2 reduces the bias and imbalance of the dataset through
the above improvements.
CLEVR [180].CLEVR is a synthetic dataset and contains 100,000 rendered images and about 1M synthetic Q&A
pairs where 853,000 questions are totally different. To make the task more challenging, questions are divided into five
categories: querying attributes, comparing attributes, existence, counting, and integer comparison and each image
is represented as a visual scene composed of simple geometric bodies, where a VQA model needs to handle novel
combinations of unseen attributes during training and goes through a long reasoning process to answer the question.
IconQA [280].IconQA consists of 96,817 Icon images and 107,439 Q&A pairs. These Icon images come from IXL
Math Learning, an open-source mathematics textbook on the Internet, and Q&A pairs are obtained by manual collection
and filtering. The questions of this dataset are mainly divided into three subtasks: 57,672 multi-image-choice, 31,578
multi-text-choice, and 18,189 filling-in-the-blank. The questions of IconQA are derived from real-world mathematical
questions, which require commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning.
5.1.2 Datasets with External Knowledge Base.
Manuscript submitted to ACM24 Kuang and Xie, et al.
KB-VQA [423].KB-VQA is the first VQA dataset requiring an external KB, which includes 700 images from the COCO
dataset and 2,402 Q&A pairs. KB-VQA has 23 templates for questions, and each question is proposed by five workers
according to one of the appropriate templates. The proposers assign different labels to questions of different knowledge
levels. Answering questions at the “KB-knowledge” level requires the use of a KB like DBpedia. The “KB-knowledge”
level questions in KB-VQA are far more than that of other contemporaneous VQA datasets.
FVQA [424].FVQA has 2,190 images and 5,826 questions which are split into five train/test sets (1,100/1,090 images
and 2,927/2,899 questions for training/testing per set). The questions can be divided into 32 categories in total. Its
annotations include not only Q&A pairs, but also extra knowledge. FVQA builds a KB by collecting knowledge triples
from WebChild, ConceptNet, and DBpedia, which contains 193,449 sentences as supporting facts related to 580 visual
concepts (234 objects, 205 scenes, and 141 attributes). This dataset contains a supporting fact in each Q&A pair.
OK-VQA [292].The Outside Knowledge-VQA (OK-VQA) dataset consists of 14,055 questions (including 12,951 unique
questions) and 14,031 real images from the COCO dataset. The labeling process of OK-VQA is divided into two steps:
first, workers are asked to provide questions that require external knowledge to answer for a given image, and then
five different workers are asked to label answers for each image-text pair. After the annotation is completed, further
filtering is required. If the answer to a question have more than five Q&A instances, the question will be deleted, thereby
ensuring an even distribution of answers and eliminating potential bias.
5.2 VQA Datasets with MLLM Benchmark
With the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), increasingly sophisticated general-purpose
benchmarks have emerged to evaluate their performance across various dimensions. These benchmarks are designed to
assess a broad range of capabilities, often with a foundation in visual question answering annotation. The creation of such
evaluation data typically involves filtering image data from extensive sources, followed by generating corresponding
question-and-answer (QA) pairs, either through automated processes or manual annotation. Although these benchmarks
are not always explicitly developed to evaluate methodologies specific to the VQA task, they can nonetheless be regarded
as generalized VQA datasets due to their shared emphasis on image-based question answering.
One of the earliest unified MLLM benchmarks, MME [ 104], compiles a substantial collection of images and generates
corresponding QA pairs to evaluate MLLM performance, emphasizing consistency and objectivity. Similar efforts have
been observed in subsequent benchmarks, such as SEEDBENCH [ 231] and SEEDBENCH-2 [ 229], both of which aim
to standardize MLLM evaluation. However, more recent benchmarks have shifted focus towards assessing specific
capabilities, expanding the scope of evaluation to include more specialized dimensions. For example, recent benchmarks
evaluate models on their ability to comprehend visual information [ 47,105,230], demonstrate reasoning skills [ 348,498],
and perform in-context learning [ 267,380]. In addition, some benchmarks address challenges such as hallucination
detection and mitigation [ 75,267], where models are tested for their ability to provide accurate information without
generating false or misleading content.
Moreover, recent developments in MLLM benchmarks have extended their evaluation scope beyond general compre-
hension tasks, venturing into highly specialized domains. These include mathematics, physics, music, medicine, and
more, as seen in datasets such as MathVista [ 282], MMMU [ 488], and CMMMU [ 496]. These domain-specific benchmarks
highlight the growing recognition that MLLMs must be versatile, capable of handling complex, domain-oriented tasks
that require a deep understanding of specialized knowledge. This multidimensional evaluation framework ensures that
MLLMs are not only assessed for their general performance but also their abilities to excel in high-stakes areas.

5.3 Evaluation Metrics
Common VQA evaluation metrics can be divided into two categories: objective evaluation metrics and subjective
evaluation metrics, which are often used for two mainstream VQA tasks: open-ended and multiple-choice.
5.3.1 Subjective Evaluation Metrics. The most common human evaluation is to ask human judges to directly evaluate
the quality of the generated answers, either from an overall perspective or from a specific dimension. These specific
dimensions need to be able to reflect the interrelated properties of the answer sentences. For example, Bai et al. [ 32]
evaluate from three dimensions: grammar, faithfulness, and coherence. If evaluating in terms of the entire answer,
human judges are usually asked to select one of three levels of fine-grained evaluation as a score, including 0 (completely
false), 1 (partially true), and 2 (exactly true).
On the FM-IQA dataset, Gao et al. [ 110] propose a Visual Turing Test (VTT) based on human evaluation. In this test,
a lot of sets of images and questions, along with their corresponding human-annotated answers or answers generated
by a VQA model, are presented to human judges. Human judges need to discriminate whether the answers are given by
humans or computers based on the given materials. If an answer of the VQA system is judged to be that of a human,
the answer passes the VTT. Finally, the percentage of answers that pass the VTT is counted, and several additional
VTTs are set to calculate the standard deviation.
5.3.2 Objective Evaluation Metrics.
QA Evaluation Metrics .Simple Accuracy [ 526] based on string matching is first proposed. For the multiple-choice
VQA task, the comparison between the predicted answer and the ground truth is straightforward. However, as generated
answers are mostly phrases consisting of multiple words in the open-ended VQA task, Simple Accuracy is often difficult
to evaluate. On the one hand, indiscriminate judgment is clearly flawed, because the severity of wrong answers varies.
For example, compared with the completely irrelevant answers obtained from prediction, the severity of answers that
contain temporal errors is significantly lower, where the punishment should be different for these situations. On the
other hand, there may be multiple matching answers to the same question, while their appropriateness may vary.
For instance, the correct answer to “What’s swimming in the water?” is “bluefish”, while “scad” means the same as
“bluefish”, and “fish” is also appropriate.
S. Antol et al. [23] propose 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦𝑉𝑄𝐴 , which is used for open-ended evaluation on the VQAv1 dataset:
𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦𝑉𝑄𝐴=min(𝑛
3,1), (26)
where𝑛is the number of predicted answers that are the same as those given by annotators. This means that the
answer predicted by the algorithm with the same answer as three or more annotations is 100% accurate. However, this
evaluation standard is also unreasonable. For example, the annotators of the COCO-VQA dataset only have consensus
on a few questions, which limits the highest accuracy of the model.
In addition, 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦𝑉𝑄𝐴 is prone to errors on “yes/no” type questions. In this type of question, the answer “yes” or
“no” may repeat more than three times in one question, which would result in a high score of both “yes” and “no” on the
𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦𝑉𝑄𝐴 . Other Metrics are shown in Appendix. F.
Generation Evaluation Metrics .Some of the metrics originally used to evaluate answer generation can also be used
in the open-ended VQA task. The mainstream evaluation metrics among them typically include Bilingual evaluation
understudy (BLEU) [ 322], Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) [ 262] and Metric for Evaluation

of Translation with Explicit Ordering (METEOR) [ 34]. The effectiveness of using these generation metrics for VQA
system evaluation has been confirmed in [ 3,132]. We give a breif introduction of BLEU metric, and the ROUGE and
METEOR are introduced in Appendix. F.
BLEU measures the quality of the answer by comparing the coincidence degree of n-gram phrases of different lengths
in the predicted answer and the real answer. The higher the coincidence degree is, the higher the quality of the answer
is. BLEU calculates the coincidence accuracy of the corresponding answer according to the following formula:
𝐶𝑃𝑛(𝐶,𝑆)=Í
𝑖Í
𝑘𝑚𝑖𝑛(ℎ𝑘(𝑐𝑖),𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑗∈𝑚ℎ𝑘(𝑠𝑖𝑗))Í
𝑖Í
𝑘ℎ𝑘(𝑐𝑖), (27)
where𝑐𝑖is the candidate answer and its corresponding group of reference answers is 𝑆𝑖={𝑠𝑖1,𝑠𝑖2,...,𝑠𝑖𝑚}∈𝑆,𝜔𝑘
represents the possible n-grams of the 𝑘-th group,ℎ𝑘(𝑐𝑖)represents the number of occurrences of 𝜔𝑘in the candidate
answer𝑐𝑖, andℎ𝑘(𝑠𝑖𝑗)represents the number of occurrences of 𝜔𝑘in the reference answer 𝑠𝑖𝑗. BLEU is the weighted
geometric average of n-grams coincidence accuracy, which represents the ratio of the correct matching times of n-grams
to the occurrence times of all n-grams. The calculation formula is as follows:
𝐵𝐿𝐸𝑈𝑁(𝐶,𝑆)=𝑏(𝐶,𝑆)𝑒𝑥𝑝(∑︁𝑁
𝑛=1𝜔𝑛𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐶𝑃𝑛(𝐶,𝑆)), (28)
where N=1,2,3,4, 𝜔𝑘is generally1

To enhance comprehension of the discrete contributions made by diverse datasets and the focal points within the
evaluation framework, we elected to examine four datasets that are widely utilized. An overview of each dataset’s
attributes and illustrative instances of image-related challenges is provided in Fig. 9.
For every dataset, we have synthesized an appraisal of the performances delivered by assorted models, encompassing
the most advanced methodologies, shown in Table. 6. This comparative analysis encompasses outcomes from con-
ventional deep learning architectures, attention mechanism-driven approaches, vision-language pre-training models,
and multimodal large language models. A critical consideration in these evaluations is the variation in experimental
configurations across different models, particularly in scenarios with limited or absent samples, which can lead to

performance comparisons facilitate a deeper understanding among researchers of the disparities between models and
inspire novel investigative endeavors.
6 PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES
We present problems and challenges that can be further improved with respect to the existing status of VQA.
Visual Reasoning Techniques .As the ability to capture information indirectly presented in images is still underde-
veloped, the current VQA is more of a “What you see is what you get” task. Knowledge inference techniques can be
applied to this problem to discover more latent knowledge. Also, more common-sense knowledge can be applied to
help machines for image understanding. The current VQA is more of a “What you see is what you get” task. Currently,
the ability to capture information indirectly presented in images is at a lower level of development.
Robustness (data bias) .VQA models are often trained on datasets that contain inherent biases in both visual and
language modalities. As a result, models tend to rely on statistical correlations rather than genuinely understanding the
relationship between the question and the image content. For example, in some datasets, certain objects or scenes are
more frequently associated with specific answers, leading the model to produce incorrect results when these patterns
are not present. This undermines the model’s ability to generalize effectively to unseen or real-world data.
Explainability .VQA models often behave as black boxes, providing answers without clear reasoning, which raises
concerns about the trustworthiness of the system. Current methods, such as attention mechanisms, only partially reveal
the decision-making process, often failing to offer human-interpretable explanations. Enhancing the explainability of
VQA systems is crucial for their adoption in sensitive fields, like medical imaging or autonomous vehicles.
Manuscript submitted to ACM28 Kuang and Xie, et al.
Natural Language Generation .Most of the methods choose from a given library of answers and answer questions
through prediction-based methods. However, the answer generation capability has significant limitations. Although
there are researches in open-ended VQA, the ability to generate answers still faces a big challenge.
7 CONCLUSION
Since the VQA task was proposed, it has received great attention and gained rapid development and wide application. This
survey presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art on VQA task from two aspects. For the understanding of
image-question pairs, feature extraction from individual modalities and information fusion methods between modalities
are introduced, with particular attention to the application of visual-language pre-training models, and multimodal large
language models. For the knowledge reasoning of graphical knowledge, we review knowledge sources and describe
methods of acquisition and specific reasoning processes, highlighting differences in the type and difficulty of the models
they include. Datasets of VQA and different evaluation metrics follow. We believe that the suggested possible future
directions will benefit the specific task of VQA as well as the general objective of visual scene understanding.

AFFECTIVE computing is an interdisciplinary research
field that aims to endow computers with the ability
to recognize, understand, express, and respond to human
emotions [1], [2]. It integrates theories and methods from
multiple disciplines such as computer science, psychology,
and cognitive science, attempting to reveal the essence of
human emotions and apply it to human-computer inter-
action and intelligent systems. The core goal of affective
computing is to enable computers to perceive, understand,
and express emotions like humans, thereby achieving more
natural and friendly human-computer interaction [3], [4],
[5], [6].

Manuscript received April 19, 2005; revised August 26, 2015.Emotion synthesis [7] is an important branch of affective
computing, which aims to enable computers to generate
emotional expressions similar to human emotions. This
ability can be realized through various common modalities,
such as facial images, speech, and text. To achieve emotion
synthesis, researchers have proposed a series of traditional
methods by analyzing the characteristics of human emo-
tional expressions and establishing mathematical models.
These models are then used to generate speech and facial
expressions with specific emotions using computers [8], [9].
Artificial intelligence has made remarkable advances in
synthesizing human emotions, marking a significant break-
through in the field. In particular, generative technology
has greatly improved the effect and application scope of
emotion synthesis [10], [11], [12]. Compared with traditional
methods, these new models can automatically learn the
characteristics of emotional expressions from massive data
without relying on manually designed rules and models
[13], [14], [15], [16]. With their powerful generation capa-
bilities, generative models can generate emotional samples
that are highly similar to real data and more flexible, greatly
expanding the research boundaries in the field of emotion
synthesis. For example, some researchers use Autoencoders
(AEs) [17] to generate speech with emotions. By modifying
this structure, they can extract speaker embeddings, isolate
timbre information, and control the flow of emotional at-
tributes [18]. Other researchers use Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) [19] to generate facial images with spe-
cific emotions. By controlling the input of the generative
model, they can generate faces expressing different emo-
tions such as happiness, sadness, and anger [20]. In recent
years, Diffusion Models (DMs) [21] and Large Language
Models (LLMs) [22] have also been widely used in emo-arXiv:2412.07116v1  [cs.LG]  10 Dec 2024JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 2
tion synthesis tasks. Some researchers use DMs to enhance
image and audio processing by employing a reconstruction
Module, which leverages noising and denoising in latent
spaces [23]. Other researchers use LLMs to generate em-
pathic conversational texts by training language models on
empathic conversations and injecting emotional information
into response generation [24]. However, to the best of our
knowledge, there is a conspicuous absence of a systematic
review that specifically focuses on generative technology for
human emotion synthesis within this burgeoning field.
This study examines how generative AI models syn-
thesize human emotions, addressing current gaps in re-
search through a systematic analysis. The overall schematic
diagram is illustrated in Fig. 1. Specifically, this paper
will firstly introduce several generative models and their
underlying mathematical principles to help readers better
understand the technical background of this field, includ-
ing AEs, GANs, DMs, LLMs, and Sequence-to-Sequence
(Seq2Seq) models [25]. AEs learn compressed data represen-
tations through encoder-decoder reconstruction, enabling
dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. GANs use
adversarial training between a generator and discrimina-
tor to produce realistic data samples. DMs generate data
by learning to reverse a noise diffusion process, often
avoiding vanishing gradients. LLMs leverage transformer
architectures and massive text datasets for human language
processing and generation. Seq2Seq models use encoder-
decoder architectures to map input sequences to output
sequences, facilitating tasks like translation and synthesis.
Then, this review summarizes the commonly used human
emotion synthesis datasets from unimodal to cross-modal.
Each dataset has annotated emotion labels according to
its purpose, covering the simplest positive and negative
emotion labels [26] to complex 32 categories of compound
emotion labels [27].
Subsequently, we categorize human emotion synthesis
into three subfields: facial emotion synthesis, speech emo-
tion synthesis, and textual emotion synthesis. The taxonomy
of this survey is shown in Fig. 2. Facial emotion synthesis in-
volves modifying facial information in computer-generated
faces to create more realistic and diverse emotions. This area
of research intersects with face reenactment [28], [29], face
manipulation [30], and talking head generation [31], [32].
Speech emotion synthesis involves altering the emotional
attributes of speech segments or generating new speech
that conveys specific emotions by manipulating acoustic
features. This section will cover various studies on Voice
Conversion [33], [34], Text-to-Speech (TTS) [35], and speech
manipulation tasks [36]. Textual emotion synthesis refers to
using computational techniques to infuse textual content
with different emotions or sentiments, thereby enhancing
its expressiveness. This section will focus on text emotion
transfer and empathetic dialogue generation.
Finally, this review summarize the prevalent evaluation
metrics employed in the task, present key findings from
multiple perspectives, and offer insights into future research
directions based on the aforementioned systematic analysis.
The main findings include: (i) Generative models have made
significant progress in emotion synthesis across multiple
modalities, including facial images, speech, and text. (ii) In
the past, GAN-based methods have demonstrated strongcapability in facial emotion synthesis, excelling at capturing
subtle nuances in expressions. However, DMs have now
emerged as a more promising alternative, offering superior
control, stronger adaptability across different modalities.
(iii) Speech emotion synthesis has benefited from the adap-
tation of GANs and Seq2Seq models, with further improve-
ments through AEs and DMs to enhance emotional depth
and prosodic control. (iv) Textual emotion synthesis has
increasingly leveraged LLMs and Seq2Seq architectures, us-
ing sentiment control and emotional valence modulation to
produce emotionally resonant content, although challenges
remain in balancing emotional expressiveness with conver-
sational coherence. (v) Both subjective and objective metrics
are essential for evaluating emotion synthesis models, with
future research focusing on refining both to better capture
emotional subtleties and align with human judgments.
Looking ahead, there are still many directions worth ex-
ploring, which include: (i) Combining different generative
models like GANs, Seq2Seqs, AEs, DMs, and LLMs can en-
hance emotion synthesis by leveraging the strengths of each
model for more accurate and realistic outputs. (ii) Exploring
new modalities like gestures, electroencephalogram (EEG)
[37], and electrocardiogram (ECG) [38], as well as cross-
modal models, expanding the potential for immersive and
interactive emotional experiences. (iii) Real-time emotion
generation on edge devices like smartphones and wearables
can enable personalized, adaptive emotional interactions,
with applications in healthcare, retail, and more. (iv) Emo-
tion synthesis can transform digital entertainment and film-
making by enabling more authentic emotional expressions
in virtual characters, enhancing storytelling, and allowing
real-time emotional adjustments in films based on audience
feedback. This research provides a framework for under-
standing how generative models replicate human emotions,
offering insights to guide future developments in the field.
Overall, the main contributions of this paper include:
•To the best of our knowledge, this review provides
the first systematic overview of human emotion syn-
thesis based on generative technology.
•By analyzing more than 230 related papers, this
review gives a taxonomy of generative technology-
based human emotion synthesis in different modali-
ties.
•We summarize commonly used datasets and eval-
uation metrics for human emotion synthesis across
different modalities.
•Finally, we discuss the current research status of
human emotion synthesis based on generation tech-
nology and present a future outlook.

approach was followed to ensure the comprehensiveness
and relevance of the literature. The overall screening pro-
cess is shown in Fig. 3. Initially, we conducted compre-
hensive searches across key academic databases, including
IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The search
strategy combined general and modality-specific keywords
related to generative models and emotion synthesis. Ex-
amples of search terms included “facial emotion synthe-
sis” + “generative models,” “speech emotion synthesis” +
“generative models,” “emotional face reenactment,” and
“emotional voice conversion,” etc., aiming to cover a wide
array of studies in these domains. To ensure the inclusion
of the most recent advancements, the search focused on
papers published between 2017 and 2024, providing a com-
prehensive overview of developments in this timeframe. To
further broaden the scope, we included terms referencing
specific generative model architectures, such as AE, GAN,
DM, LLM, and Seq2Seq. The initial search yielded more than
270 papers.

up to November 2024, including both journal and confer-
ence papers; (2) Research focusing on the application of
generative models to human emotion synthesis in various
modalities; (3) Studies in which extensive experiments were
conducted and fully evaluated.
After the initial retrieval, a two-step filtering process was
applied to ensure the focus remained on emotion synthesis.
Studies whose primary aim was not related to emotional
generation or did not involve the use of generative models
were excluded. Furthermore, we eliminated papers with
incremental contributions to maintain the diversity of the
sources reviewed. The final set of selected works provides
a detailed overview of the current and impactful advance-
ments in the field.
By following this structured methodology, we ensured
the thoroughness and relevance of the selected studies,
offering a timely and well-rounded perspective on the
role of generative technology in human emotion synthesis
across multiple modalities. This process ultimately enabled
a focused analysis of both seminal works and the latest
advancements, contributing to a deepened understanding
of generative models in affective computing.
3 E MOTION MODEL
Emotion is commonly understood as a complex and ever-
changing state of mind and body, which can be triggered
by various interactions [39], perceptions, or thoughts [40].
It encompasses a wide range of experiences, cognitive eval-
uations, behavioral responses, physiological reactions [41],
and communicative expressions. In the realm of human
cognition, emotions play a crucial role in decision-making
[42], shaping our perceptions, and guiding our interactions
with others [43].
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the study of emotions has re-
sulted in the development of different theoretical models,
which can be primarily categorized into discrete emotions
theory and multidimensional emotion theory [44]. In the

most basic discrete emotion framework, emotions are sim-
ply categorized as positive or negative, also known as polar-
ity [45], [46]. Within this framework, the term ""emotion"" is
often replaced with ""sentiment,"" which sometimes includes
a neutral category as well. However, this sentiment cate-
gorization is considered too simplistic for certain contexts.
Therefore, the more detailed discrete emotion theory catego-
rizes basic emotions that are universally recognized across
cultures into six or eight types [47], [48], [49]. On the other
hand, the multidimensional emotions theory suggests that
emotions can be viewed along a continuous spectrum, often
defined by dimensions such as 2D (valence and arousal)
[50] or 3D (valence, arousal, and dominance) [51]. These
theoretical perspectives provide valuable insights into the
complex nature of human emotions and serve as founda-
tional principles for emotion synthesis.
By considering emotions in generative tasks, machines
not only understand and process information, but also
become attuned to the emotional dimensions of human
experience. This enriches the human-machine interaction
landscape and opens up new avenues for the development
of empathetic and intuitive AI developments.
4 D IFFERENCE
The current state of research in affective computing pri-
marily focuses on areas such as human sentiment analysis
[10], emotion detection, and emotion recognition [12]. These
tasks have a long-standing tradition and are considered
significant when viewed in a broader context. For instance,
Saxena et al. [58] conducted a survey on emotion recognition
methods, examining facial, physiological, speech, and text
approaches. They highlighted key techniques like Stationary
Wavelet Transform and Particle Swarm Optimization. In
another study, Nandwani et al. [59] analyzed sentiment
analysis and emotion detection methods, discussing theJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 5
transition from lexicon-based to deep learning techniques.
They addressed challenges and emphasized the need for
advanced and versatile models to improve accuracy and
adaptability across different domains and languages. Canal
et al. [60] presented a systematic literature review on fa-
cial emotion recognition from images. They categorized
the techniques into classical and neural network-based ap-
proaches, highlighting the slightly higher accuracy of clas-
sical methods compared to neural networks, despite the
latter’s generalization capabilities.
Generative models currently constitute one of the main-
stream directions in artificial intelligence research. However,
most of the existing reviews only focus on the synthesis of a
single modality, such as facial images [52], [53], speech [54],
[55], and text [56], [57], and many of them ignore the emo-
tional aspects of the synthesis process. The most relevant
work to ours is [9]. This paper provides a thorough review
of GANs in synthesizing human emotions, with a focus
on facial expressions, speech, and cross-modal synthesis.
It details various GAN architectures, their applications in
emotion synthesis, challenges faced, and future directions.
By evaluating numerous studies, it highlights how GANs
enhance emotion recognition accuracy, offer data augmen-
tation, and create realistic, diverse emotional samples across
modalities. However, the key distinction between our sur-
vey and the aforementioned one lies in the fact that ours
exclusively focuses on emotion synthesis. In addition, this
review introduces a series of generation models other than
GANs, such as the Seq2Seq model in the field of emotional
speech synthesis, and LLMs in text emotion synthesis.
In summary, the differences are shown in Table 2. Our
survey is based on a clear definition of human emotion
synthesis, focusing on the application of generative models
in this emerging field, as well as the latest research develop-
ments in various sub-fields.
5 G ENERATIVE MODEL
The generative model [61] refers to a model that can be
described as generating data, belonging to a type of proba-
bility model. In machine learning, it can model data directly
or establish conditional probability distributions between
variables via Bayes’ theorem, allowing the generation of
new data not present in the training set. In this section,
we explain the mathematics of different generative models,
including AE, GAN, DM, LLM, and Seq2Seq.
5.1 Auto-Encoder (AE)
AEs [17] are neural network models used in generative tasks
to efficiently learn data representations. These models com-
press input data into simplified patterns, then reconstruct
it by preserving key features while minimizing errors in
the reproduction process. As a variant of AE, Variational
Auto-Encoders (VAEs) introduced by Kingma and Welling
in 2013 [62], offer a principled approach to learning latent
data representations to account for data uncertainty and
variability, making them well-suited for generative tasks.
The training of VAEs is guided by the maximization of the
Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO), which can be expressed as
follows:
ELBO =Eqϕ(z|x)[logpθ(x|z)]−DKL[qϕ(z|x)∥p(z)],(1)where the encoder, qϕ(z|x), maps the input data xto a dis-
tribution over the latent space characterized by parameters
ϕ. Typically, this distribution is assumed to be Gaussian,
with the encoder outputting the mean and variance of
the distribution. The latent variable z, sampled from this
distribution, is then fed into the decoder, pθ(x|z), which
attempts to reconstruct the input data, where θdenotes the
parameters of the decoder. In the Equation (1), the first term
is the expected log-likelihood of the data given the latent
variables, encouraging accurate reconstruction of the data.
The second component measures how closely the encoded
data patterns match an expected statistical distribution p(z),
using the Kullback-Leibler divergence formula. By optimiz-
ing the ELBO, VAEs learn to balance the trade-off between
fidelity in data reconstruction and adherence to a structured
latent space.
5.2 Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
GANs [19] are distinguished by their unique training
methodology, which leverages the concept of adversarial
learning, setting up a dynamic competition between two
distinct neural networks: the generator and the discrimina-
tor. The generator network, G, aims to map latent space
vectors, drawn from a prior distribution pz(z), to data
space, effectively generating new data samples that mimic
the distribution of real data, pdata(x). In contrast, the dis-
criminator network, D, is trained to distinguish between
samples drawn from the real data distribution and those
produced by the generator. The competition between net-
works steadily improves their performance, ultimately en-
abling the generator to create lifelike outputs. The training
of GANs is formulated as a min-max game, which can
be formally represented by the following value function
V(G, D):
min
Gmax
DV(D, G) =Ex∼pdata (x)[logD(x)]+
Ez∼pz(z)[log(1 −D(G(z)))],(2)
where the first term represents the expected log-probability
that the discriminator correctly identifies real data sam-
ples as real. The second term represents the expected log-
probability that the discriminator correctly identifies fake
samples (generated by G) as fake. Training GANs involves
alternating between optimizing Dto maximize V(D, G)for
fixed G(improving D’s accuracy in distinguishing real from
fake samples) and optimizing Gto minimize V(D, G)for
fixed D(improving G’s ability to generate realistic samples).
This adversarial training process continues until a state of
equilibrium is reached where Ggenerates samples indis-
tinguishable from real data by D. The adversarial training
mechanism of GANs has proven to be highly effective for
generating complex, high-dimensional data.
5.3 Diffusion Model (DM)
DMs [21] have emerged as a class of powerful generative
models that synthesize data by gradually refining random
noise into structured patterns. The fundamental principle
behind DMs involves two phases: a forward (noising) phase
and a reverse (denoising) phase. In the forward phase, step
by step, the model gradually adds random noise to the dataJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 6
until the original information becomes completely obscured.
This process is described by a Markov chain that gradually
corrupts the original data distribution, x0, into a tractable
noise distribution, xT, over Tsteps. Mathematically, this
can be expressed through a sequence of conditional proba-
bilities:
q(xt|xt−1) =N(xt;p
1−βtxt−1, βtI), (3)
where βtrepresents the variance of the noise added at each
step, and Iis the identity matrix. The sequence of βtvalues
is predefined to control the noise level at each step, ensuring
a smooth transition from data to noise. The reverse phase
aims to learn the reverse process, modeling the conditional
distribution of xt−1given xt, effectively denoising the data.
The model, typically parameterized by a neural network, is
trained to approximate the reverse conditional probabilities:
pθ(xt−1|xt) =N(xt−1;µθ(xt, t),Σθ(xt, t)), (4)
where the parameters µθand Σθare functions learned
during training, with θrepresenting the model’s parameters.
The model learns by minimizing the gap between real and
generated data distributions, using either statistical bounds
or direct probability optimization. Despite their computa-
tional intensity, DMs have emerged as a cornerstone in
generative modeling due to their impressive performance
in generating high-quality samples.
5.4 Large Language Model (LLM)
Large Language Models are AI systems trained on massive
text datasets, using billions of parameters to learn language
patterns. Their deep understanding of language enables
human-like text comprehension and generation, transform-
ing how computers process natural language. The advent
of Transformer architecture, developed by Vaswani et al. in
2017 [22], marked a significant breakthrough in language
modeling.
The training objective of LLMs can generally be de-
scribed as learning a conditional probability distribu-
tion over sequences. Given an input sequence X=
(x1, x2, . . . , x T), the model maximizes the likelihood of
generating each token based on prior tokens, represented
as:
p(X) =TY
t=1p(xt|x<t) (5)
where p(xt|x<t)is the probability of token xtgiven its con-
textx<t. A key feature of this process is the attention mech-
anism, which allows the model to dynamically focus on
different parts of the context at each step. In self-attention,
the probability of generating each token is influenced by
a weighted sum of the context, with attention weights αtj
computed as:
αtj=exp(qt·kj√dk)
PT
k=1exp(qt·kk√dk)(6)
and the new token representation ztis given by:
zt=TX
j=1αtjvj (7)By analyzing relationships between tokens, the attention
system helps the model understand context and produce
coherent, relevant text.
So far, several LLMs have gained prominence, includ-
ing Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) [63] series,
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT) [64], eXtreme Language Understanding Network
(XLNet) [65], and Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)
[66], etc. These models have been pre-trained on vast
amounts of text data and can effectively fine-tune for spe-
cific tasks, such as language translation, sentiment analysis,
and text generation [67], [68].
5.5 Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Model
Seq2Seq model [25] is a neural network architecture de-
signed for tasks involving sequential input-output pairs.
It follows an encoder-decoder structure, where each com-
ponent is typically implemented with recurrent neural net-
works (RNNs) or Transformers in later models.
One defining feature of Seq2Seq models is their focus
on sequential data, which differentiates them from models
like GANs or VAEs that do not inherently account for
sequential dependencies. Unlike general language models,
Seq2Seq models specialize in transforming one sequence
into another, effectively capturing both immediate and dis-
tant patterns in the data.
In the Seq2Seq model, the encoder processes the input
sequence (x1, x2, . . . , x T)to produce a context vector c,
often represented by the encoder’s final hidden state:
c=hT (8)
where hTencapsulates the input sequence’s essential infor-
mation. The decoder then uses this context vector to gen-
erate the output sequence (y1, y2, . . . , y T′)one element at a
time, conditioned on cand previously generated outputs:
st=g(yt−1, st−1, c) (9)
p(yt|y<t, x) =softmax (Wst) (10)
where stis the hidden state at time t, and Wis a weight
matrix for calculating the output distribution.
Seq2Seq models are effective for handling variable-
length input and output sequences, making them well-
suited for applications like translation, summarization, and
question answering, where coherent sequence transforma-
tion is required. The differences between Seq2Seq models
and other generative models are shown in Table 3.
6 D ATABASES
The performance of human emotion synthesis tasks based
on generative models is closely tied to the quality and
richness of the utilized datasets. To be specific, the diver-
sity and scope of the datasets play a crucial role in the
model’s ability to generalize across various emotional states,
cultural contexts, and individual differences. The structure
and content of emotion databases directly shape how re-
searchers design and build emotion synthesis models. The
structure, annotation scheme, and inherent biases of the
datasets influence the choice of model architecture, loss
functions, and training strategies. Furthermore, the size andJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 7

quality of the datasets influence the choice between end-to-
end learning approaches and modular architectures, with
large, high-quality datasets enabling end-to-end learning of
emotion synthesis, while smaller or noisier datasets might
necessitate the use of pre-trained components or transfer
learning techniques. Based on these emotional datasets of
different modalities, such as facial images, speech, and text,
the designed models can imitate human emotional expres-
sions with high precision from different aspects. Table 4
summarizes the common datasets used in the field of human
emotion synthesis, providing a comprehensive overview of
the available resources for researchers and practitioners in
this domain.
7 F ACIAL EMOTION SYNTHESIS
Facial emotion synthesis is a crucial research field within
human emotion synthesis, aiming to generate faces that ex-
press specified emotions. This technology holds significant
academic value in computer graphics and computer vision,
while also demonstrating great promise for applications
in virtual reality (VR), gaming, and interactive computer
systems. Based on existing works, we can broadly categorize
facial emotion synthesis into three main approaches: face
reenactment (Section 7.1), talking head generation (Section
7.3), and facial manipulation (Section 7.2). The related works
are illustrated in Table 5.
7.1 Face Reenactment
Face reenactment focuses on transferring facial expressions
from a source actor to a target face, preserving the identity
of the target while adopting the emotional expressions of the
source. This technique is particularly useful in applications
like film dubbing, virtual avatars, and privacy-preserving
video conferencing.
In facial reenactment, there are some tasks that empha-
size emotional attributes in the face. For example, in [90],
Tripathy et al. introduced ICface, a GAN-based face anima-
tor that manipulated facial expressions in a given image.
The animation process was guided by interpretable control
signals, such as head pose angles and Action Units (AU)
values, which were derived from various sources, allowing
for selective emotion transfer. Zeng et al. [91] proposed
DAE-GAN, which employed two deforming autoencoders
to separate identity and pose in unlabeled videos, reducingthe need for manual annotation. It realized emotional trans-
fer between different identities with varied poses using con-
ditional generation and disentangled features. Strizhkova
et al. [92] proposed a novel method for emotion editing in
head reenactment videos by manipulating the latent space
of a pre-trained GAN. This technique disentangled emotion,
identity, and pose within the latent space, allowing for the
direct modification of emotions in the reenactment videos
without affecting the person’s identity or the speech-related
facial expressions. Groth et al. [93] designed a new method
to achieve emotion mapping by generating correctly rec-
ognized expressions, using video reenactments to influence
the intensity of the emotion. In [94], Ali et al. utilized two
encoders to separately capture expression from a source and
identity from a target image, merging these features to cre-
ate expressive images, enhanced by innovative consistency
losses for both expression and identity features. In Fig. 5,
Xue et al. presented LSGAN [95], employing a transforma-
tive generator that combined target expression labels with
specific facial region features to produce clear and distinct
facial expressions in images. Shao et al. [96] utilized dual
parallel generators and wavelet-based discriminators for
facial expression translation, enhancing realism by focusing
on key areas with an attention mechanism and capturing
expression details across scales without the bidirectional
translation interference seen in single-generator models.
Fig. 5. A mask-based GAN [95] for face reenactment. The system
included four main components. A Semantic Mask Generator (SMG)
produced masks for specific facial regions (eyes, mouth, cheeks). Then
these masks were encoded into latent codes through an Adversarial
Autoencoder (AAE). A Transformative Generator (TG) used these codes
along with target expression labels to generate new facial expressions,
with an AU-intensity Discriminator (AUD) that assessed their quality and
intensity.
7.2 Face Manipulation
Face manipulation involves editing specific attributes of a
face, such as changing expressions, age, hairstyles, etc., to
generate different versions of the same person. It can be
seen that this has a completely different goal compared to
face reenactment which transfers the expressions and move-
ments of a source face to a target face. Researchers in this
field focus on the alteration of specific facial attributes while
preserving the remaining attributes unchanged, under the
condition of explicit predefined facial information, thereby
effecting changes in emotional expression. Works in this
field are mainly based on GAN and its variants [20], [30],
[97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106]. ForJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 8

instance, in [30], Xie et al. proposed a novel approach, using
GAN equipped with consistency preservation and feature
entropy regularization techniques. This innovation achieved
improved results in attribute translation, particularly in
preserving consistency and reducing feature entropy. Song
et al. [107] utilized facial geometry to guide expression
creation but required a neutral face image, making the pro-
cess more complex. It consisted of two GANs for changing
and removing expressions. In [108], Kong te al. proposed
a dual-path GAN for emotion synthesis and introduced a
learning strategy based on a separation discriminator to
train it more efficiently. In [109], Tang et al. introduced
structured latent space and perceptual loss to achieve fine-
grained expression manipulation while preserving identity
and global facial shape. Patashnik et al. [110] innovatively
utilized text-driven manipulation techniques, in conjunction
with the extraordinary visual concept encoding abilities
of CLIP and StyleGAN, to specify desired attributes like
different emotional facial expressions. Liu et al. [111] first
proposed a novel general framework, EvoGAN, that com-
bined an evolutionary algorithm (EA) and GAN to work as
a whole, which generated face images with more compound
expressions. In [112], Tang et al. proposed a novel ECGAN
for generating faces with different emotions based on the
input expression attribute vector. And in [113], the innova-
tion in Sola et al.’s work was the use of ECGAN, a novel
expression-conditioned GAN, to incorporate expression in-
formation into unmasking processes, resulting in improved
naturalness and expression fidelity of generated faces. In
[114], Lindt et al. updated the Conditional Adversarial Au-
toencoder (CAAE) [115] framework to manipulate facial ex-
pressions in images based on continuous two-dimensional
emotion labels, representing valence and arousal.
7.3 Talking Head Generation
Talking head generation aims to create realistic, animated
facial models that can speak and emote based on input
audio or text. This approach is particularly valuable in creat-
ing virtual assistants, digital newscasters, and personalized
content for educational or entertainment purposes.
Fig. 6. A DM-based talking head generation model from [23]. This archi-
tecture started by extracting conditions from multiple modalities: audio,
visual, and textual inputs. Specifically, the emotion intensity block used
a pretrained CLIP text encoder to convert text prompts into embeddings
that represented the underlying emotional content. These embeddings,
reflecting nuanced emotional states and their strengths, were then inte-
grated into the DM’s denoising process.
A series of works that incorporate emotion synthesis
into talking head generation have been explored. For ex-
ample, Eskimez et al. [116] presented a novel system for
generating talking faces, achieving independent control of
emotional expressions by disregarding the emotions ex-
pressed in the input speech audio and instead conditioning
the face generation on an independent categorical emotion
variable. In [117], Vougioukas et al. developed a special-
ized GAN that uses three discriminators to create detailed
facial expressions that match a speaker’s emotional state.
As illustrated in Fig. 6, Zhang et al. presented EmoTalker
[23], a framework for emotionally editable talking face gen-
eration, utilizing a diffusion model and a novel Emotion
Intensity Block, and integrating a custom dataset to enhance
emotion interpretation. In [118], Zeng et al. presented ET-
GAN, an end-to-end system for generating talking faces
with tailored expressions from guiding videos, identity im-
ages, and arbitrary audio, utilizing multiple encoders for
identity, expression, and audio-lip synchronization, along-
side advanced frame and spatial-temporal discriminators.
Gan et al. [119] generated synchronized emotion coeffi-
cients and emotion-driven facial images through flow-based
and vector-quantized models, while using lightweight emo-
tion prompts or CLIP supervision for model control andJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 9
adaptation. In [120], Tan et al. used the regularized flow
model to generate emotion-related expression coefficients,
mapped the input emotion coefficients to the latent space,
and generated diverse expression dynamics based on audio
and emotion labels, while achieving high-fidelity restoration
of emotional details through a vector quantization image
generator. In another work [121], they used orthogonal
basis decomposition to decompose facial dynamics into
independent latent spaces of lip shape, head posture, and
emotional expression, allowing the model to adjust the
relevant expression coefficients in each independent latent
space.JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 10

8 S PEECH EMOTION SYNTHESIS
Speech emotion synthesis is a critical research field within
human emotion synthesis, focusing on the manipulation
and generation of acoustic features in speech signals to alter
or create specific emotional states. This area of study aims
to modify key vocal parameters such as volume, intonation,
pitch, speaking rate, and timbre to effectively convey a
desired emotional state in synthesized speech. Based on
existing works, we divide it into voice conversion (Section
8.1) ,text-to-speech (Section 8.2) and speech manipulation
(Section 8.3). Table 6 illustrates the overall papers about
speech emotion synthesis.
8.1 Voice Conversion
Voice conversion technology modifies a speaker’s voice to
express different emotions while keeping the original words
intact. This enables emotional dubbing in films and games,
and helps create more natural-sounding AI assistants.
For instance, in [76], Zhou et al. leveraged VAW-GAN
and deep emotional features from speech emotion recog-
nition to describe emotional prosody. By using adjustable
emotional features to guide the decoder, this approach
could transform speech to express both familiar and new
emotions. In [137], they combined VAW-GAN and Con-
tinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for advanced spectrum
and prosody conversion. By incorporating CWT-based F0
modeling, the system uniquely enhanced the granularity
of prosody representation. In [138], they focused on disen-
tangling and re-composing emotional elements in speech,
innovatively employing CWT for detailed prosody analysis
and integrating F0 conditioning in the decoder to enhance
emotion conversion performance. Similarly, in [139], they
proposed a CycleGAN-based model [140] that did not
require parallel data. It utilized CWT to analyze F0 on
multiple scales, enabling detailed prosody modification. In
[141], Fu et al. also presented an improved CycleGAN-
based model that incorporated a transformer to augment
temporal dependencies and integrated curriculum learn-
ing and a fine-grained level discriminator, enhancing the
model’s ability to capture and convert emotional nuances
in speech more effectively. Rizos et al. [142] utilized class-
conditional GAN and an auxiliary domain classifier to gen-
erate emotional speech samples. In [143], Elgaar et al. in-
troduced a Factorized Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder
(FHVAE) for multi-speaker and multi-domain emotional
voice conversion, enhancing disentangled representation
and emotion conversion quality through novel algorithms
and loss functions. Gao et al. [144] used style transfer
autoencoders for emotional voice conversion without par-
allel data, leveraging disentangled representation learning
to modify emotion-related characteristics. In Fig. 7, Chen et
al. introduced a Tacotron2-based framework using emotion
disentangling modules [145] to achieve cross-speaker emo-
tion transfer by separating speaker identity from emotion. In
[146], Oh et al. proposed the DurFlex-EVC model, integrat-
ing a style autoencoder and unit aligner for advanced con-
trol and flexibility. It leveraged HuBERT features, denoising
diffusion models, and self-supervised learning to modify
emotional tones while maintaining linguistic content and
unique vocal traits. Moreover, there were also some worksrelated to emotional voice conversion based on StarGAN
[147], [148], [149], AE [150], and Seq2Seq [151], [152], [153].
Fig. 7. A two-stage model [145] for voice conversion. In the first stage,
the method separated emotional and content features from speech us-
ing an attention-based mechanism, incorporating inter-speech relation
to model emotional strength. The second stage employed a conversion
adaptation strategy, leveraging a multi-view consistency mechanism to
ensure that the emotional nuances were accurately transformed while
the core speech content remained intact. This framework facilitated
precise control over the emotional output of synthesized speech.
8.2 Text-to-Speech (TTS)
TTS aims to generate natural-sounding speech based on the
semantic content and context of the input text. This tech-
nology is particularly crucial for enabling more engaging
and human-like interactions with virtual assistants, audio-
book narrations, and personalized content delivery. Some
researchers have attempted to incorporate emotional factors
into TTS systems to synthesize speech with emotional ex-
pressiveness.
For example, in [154], Lei et al. introduced a unified
model for fine-grained emotional speech synthesis, obtain-
ing fine-grained emotion expressions with emotion descrip-
tors or phoneme-level manual labels. Li et al. [155] de-
veloped DiCLET-TTS, which improves emotional speech
synthesis by combining emotion separation techniques with
advanced probability-based decoding. In [156], Tits et al. ex-
plored adapting a Deep Convolutional TTS (DCTTS) model
to various emotions using minimal emotional data. In [157],
Schnell et al. leveraged WaveNet and emotion intensity
extraction using attention LSTM and transformer models,
demonstrating increased perceived emotion accuracy. Wu et
al [158] synthesized emotional speech with limited labeled
data, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised
models. In [159], Um et al. employed an inter-to-intra dis-
tance ratio algorithm and an effective interpolation tech-
nique to achieve nuanced emotion intensity control. In [81],
Im et al. proposed EmoQ-TTS, a system that synthesized
expressive emotional speech by conditioning phoneme-wise
emotion information with fine-grained emotion intensity,
using intensity pseudo-labels generated via distance-based
intensity quantization. Hortal et al. [160] combined Tacotron
2 with GANs to modulate prosody, allowing customiza-
tion of inferred speech with specified emotions. Guo et al.
[161] presented ""EmoDiff,"" a DM-based model that enabled
intensity-controllable emotional speech synthesis using a
soft-label guidance technique. Li et al. [162] utilized the
Tacotron framework, enhanced with emotion classifiers and
style loss, to generate expressive, controllable emotional
speech efficiently. In [163], Lei et al. introduced a novel
method integrating global-level, utterance-level, and local-
level modules to achieve precise emotion modeling andJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 12
transfer, allowing for versatile emotional expression in syn-
thesized speech. In Fig. 8, Li et al. created a system [164]
that extracts emotion patterns independent of the speaker’s
voice, allowing emotions to be transferred between speakers
and adjusted in intensity. In [165], Li et al. developed a
technique that analyzes speech style at different scales,
capturing both broad and fine details to produce more con-
trollable and expressive synthetic voices. In [166], Tang et al.
introduced mix methods, enabling the manual combination
of noise at runtime to produce diverse emotional mixtures,
which was validated through evaluations demonstrating its
capability to generate speech with various mixed emotions.
Fig. 8. A Tacotron2-based TTS model from [164]. This system integrated
an Emotion Disentangling Module (EDM) that utilized dual encoders
to separate emotion-related features from speaker identity, refining the
emotion embedding for clearer expression without speaker leakage. An
identity controller maintained the target speaker’s identity by incorporat-
ing speaker-specific information, enabling the synthesis of emotionally
expressive speech consistent with the target speaker’s vocal character-
istics.
8.3 Speech Manipulation
Speech manipulation focuses on modifying various aspects
of speech signals, such as the speaker’s identity or linguistic
content. It shares similarities with face manipulation in Sec-
tion 7.2, as both aim to alter or control specific attributes of
human-generated data, be it facial features or speech char-
acteristics. Recently, some researchers have begun exploring
how to manipulate the emotional attributes of speech.
For instance, in [79], Jia et al. presented ET-GAN, an in-
novative cross-language emotion transfer system for speech
synthesis, which was unique for not necessitating parallel
training data and utilized CycleGAN, achieving signifi-
cant improvements in emotional accuracy and naturalness
of synthetic speech. In [167], Matsumoto et al. utilized
WaveNet and auxiliary features like voiced, unvoiced, and
silence flags to generate speech-like emotional sounds with-
out linguistic content, enhancing emotional expressiveness
control. In [168], Wang et al. presented Emo-CampNet,
a text-based speech editing model. It integrated emotion
attributes and a context-aware mask prediction network,
employing generative adversarial training and data aug-
mentation to enhance emotional expressiveness and speaker
variability in edited speech. In [36], Inoue et al. introduced a
novel emotion editing technique in speech synthesis utiliz-
ing a hierarchical emotion distribution extractor within the
FastSpeech2 framework [169], enabling fine-grained, quan-
titative emotion control at phoneme, word, and utterance
levels for dynamic and nuanced speech generation.JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 13

Fig. 9. A text emotion transfer model from [183]. During training, the
model restored a corrupted input by using a stable ""style vector"" derived
from the preceding sentence to condition the reconstruction process.
A new style vector allowed precise, targeted style modifications, or
""targeted restyling,"" during inference by adjusting the direction and
magnitude of the style shift relative to a baseline, using a few exemplar
sentences to define the desired output style.
9 T EXTUAL EMOTION SYNTHESIS
Textual emotion synthesis is a vital research field within
human emotion synthesis, focusing on the generation of
texts that possess specific emotional, sentiment, or em-
pathetic attributes. This area of study aims to create or
modify written content to convey desired emotional states,
sentiments, or empathetic responses, thereby enhancing the
expressiveness and impact of textual communication. Based
on existing works, we consider the following two types of
tasks: text emotion transfer (Section 9.1) and empathetic di-
alogue generation (Section 9.2). Table 7 shows the literature
about textual emotion synthesis.
9.1 Text Emotion Transfer
Text emotion transfer focuses on transforming the emotional
tone or sentiment of an existing text while preserving its
core semantic content. It allows for the modification of neu-
tral text into emotionally charged content, or the alteration
of one emotional state to another.
For example, in [184], Mohammadibaghmolaei et al. pro-
posed a text emotion transfer technique based on masked
language modeling and transfer learning, and a GPT-2
model underwent training to construct an initial sentence
based on its altered sequences, allowing the model to per-
form efficiently even with limited emotion-annotated data.
A novel text sentiment transfer methodology was proposed
by Li et al. [26] in which they employed a three-step
process—Delete, Retrieve, and Generate. This approach,
powered by unsupervised learning and neural sequence-to-
sequence models, effectively altered sentiment while retain-
ing content. In [185], Jin et al. introduced the IMaT model
that constructed a pseudo-parallel corpus through semantic
alignment, then applied a sequence-to-sequence model for
attribute translation, refining this alignment across itera-
tions. Wu et al. [186] proposed a two-stage ""Mask and Infill""
methodology that significantly enhanced the performance
of non-parallel text sentiment transfer. Following the ""mask
and infill"" method, in [187], Malmi et al. introduced an
innovative unsupervised method using padded masked
language models (MLMs) for sentiment transfer, using a
padded MLM variant to avoid having to predetermine the
number of inserted tokens. In [188], Yang et al. presented a
technique leveraging language models as discriminators forunsupervised sentiment manipulation, enhancing stability
and content fidelity in generated text. In [189], Shen et al. de-
veloped a technique for text sentiment transfer without par-
allel data, utilizing refined alignment of latent representa-
tions, which effectively separated content from style, allow-
ing for sentiment modification by mapping sentences to a
style-independent content vector, then decoding this vector
into another style. Zhang et al. [190] employed GAN for sen-
timent transfer across different text domains, innovatively
combining adversarial and reinforcement learning with a
cross-domain sentiment transfer model, enhancing the abil-
ity to generate emotionally nuanced text while maintaining
domain-specific content. In Fig. 9, Riley et al. leveraged
T5 to extract a style vector from preceding sentences and
used it to provide extra conditioning for the decoder [183].
Huang et al. introduced a method [191] based on Cycle-
consistent Adversarial AutoEncoders, comprising LSTM au-
toencoders, adversarial style transfer networks, and cycle-
consistent constraints, innovating unsupervised text style
transfer. In [192], Luo et al. proposed the Seq2SentiSeq
model, incorporating sentiment intensity via a Gaussian
kernel in the decoder, enhancing sentiment control. They
trained the model using cycle reinforcement learning, which
maintains the original message while changing emotional
tone without requiring matched data pairs.
9.2 Empathetic Dialogue Generation
Empathetic dialogue generation is a crucial aspect of creat-
ing more human-like and emotionally intelligent conversa-
tional agents. It goes beyond simply generating contextually
relevant responses and focuses on incorporating emotional
understanding and support into the generated dialogue.
A lot of researchers focused on how to generate re-
sponses with specific emotional tendencies or more empa-
thy by LLMs. For example, in [193], Li et al. employed the
Emotional Chain-of-Thought (ECoT) technique, enhancing
Large Language Models’ capability for nuanced emotional
text generation, focusing on human emotional intelligence
alignment. Yang et al. [194] provided a Hybrid Empathetic
Framework (HEF) that used SEMs as flexible enhancements
to LLMs, implementing a two-stage emotion prediction
strategy and an emotion cause perception strategy. In [195],
Sun et al. utilized the Chain of Emotion-aware Empathetic
prompting (CoNECT) for better context understanding and
emotional engagement. In [196], Lee et al. investigated GPT-
3’s capacity for empathetic dialogue generation, employ-
ing in-context learning in zero-shot and few-shot settings.
Casas et al. [24] introduced an empathic chatbot framework
utilizing transformer-based language models for generating
responses that recognized and adapted to the user’s emo-
tional state. In [197], Chen et al. enhanced the empathetic
responses of ChatGLM-6B by fine-tuning it with a special-
ized dataset comprising over 2 million multi-turn empathy
conversation samples.
Apart from LLMs, there are some studies on emotional
or empathetic dialogue generation based on models like
Seq2Seq model and conditional variational autoencoder
(CVAE). For example, as shown in Fig. 10, Song et al. pro-
posed an emotional dialogue system, EmoDS [198], that en-
hanced a Seq2Seq framework with a lexicon-based attentionJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 15
Fig. 10. A empathetic dialogue generation system from [198]. The
system employed a bidirectional LSTM encoder to process the input text
into a vector representation, which initialized a decoder. This decoder,
guided by an emotion classifier and enriched with a lexicon-based
attention mechanism, integrated emotional lexicon words seamlessly
into the responses.
mechanism and an emotion classifier, generating dialogue
responses that expressed specified emotions, either explic-
itly or implicitly. In [199], Zhou et al. introduced an Emo-
tional Chatting Machine (ECM) that integrated internal and
external memory mechanisms along with emotion category
embeddings. In [200], Kong et al. proposed a model that
effectively combined CGANs with either standard Seq2Seq
or CVAE models to produce dialogue responses with the
specified sentiment. Li et al. [201] introduced a novel Dual-
View CVAE model that synthesized emotional dialogue,
changing the emotional expression of responses with higher
content relevance. In [202], Xu et al. proposed a framework
that incorporated multi-task learning and dual attention
mechanisms, effectively decoupling and processing content
and emotional information from the input. Asghar et al.
[203] suggested an enhanced Seq2Seq model that incorpo-
rated three emotional strategies for the input, training, and
inference processes, which was based on a designed dictio-
nary with Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) scores.
In [204], Colombo et al. employed a Seq2Seq architecture
augmented by emotion embeddings and a VAD lexicon
for word and sequence-level emotion modeling. It utilized
an affect regularizer to favor emotionally charged words
and an affect sampling method for generating emotionally
relevant diverse responses. Huang et al. [205] introduced a
novel approach to integrate emotions into dialogue genera-
tion by appending an emotion token to the dialogue input
or injecting the emotion directly into the decoder. In [206],
Lin et al. proposed a model integrating Transformer and
CVAE, with an emotion perception encoder and a BERT-
based emotion classification model to embed emotional
intelligence, enabling the generation of nuanced and con-
textually relevant empathetic responses.
In addition to the aforementioned methods, there have
been several research efforts exploring the use of GANs
to achieve empathetic dialogue generation. For example,
in [207], [208], Wang et al. developed SentiGAN, an inno-
vative structure featuring numerous generators alongsidea singular multi-class discriminator. This setup encouraged
each generator to concentrate on crafting text samples that
distinctly exhibited a designated sentiment label. Chen et
al. [209] utilized GAN with multiple classifiers to enhance
emotional dialogue production, with an emotion discrim-
inative model to align the generated dialogue’s emotion
with the intended one. Bi et al. [210] utilized a diffusion
model-based approach to generate empathetic responses,
distinctive for its use of multi-grained control signals, incor-
porating communication mechanism, intent, and semantic
frame as control levels, enabling nuanced guidance over the
generated responses. In [211], Chen et al. proposed CTGAN
for emotional text generation by incorporating emotion la-
bels, allowing for the production of text that aligned with
specific emotional tones within variable-length outputs.JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 16

10 E VALUATION METRIC
In the field of human emotion synthesis, several commonly
used evaluation metrics are employed to assess the quality
of generated content across the three modalities of facial
images, speech, and text. These metrics provide a com-
prehensive assessment of the synthesized emotions from
various perspectives. While some evaluation indicators are
universal and applicable to all modalities, others are exclu-
sive to specific modalities, as illustrated in Table 8.
For common evaluation indicators, there are usually
two forms: user study and accuracy. User studies are a
qualitative evaluation method that assesses the quality of
generated content from aspects such as clarity, naturalness,
and emotional authenticity. These studies involve gathering
feedback and opinions from human participants to gauge
their perception and experience of the synthesized emo-
tions. For example, in tasks like face reenactment, where
emotional authenticity is critical, researchers conduct a ""Real
vs. Fake"" perceptual study on platforms like Amazon Me-
chanical Turk (AMT) to evaluate the outputs."" In the field
of TTS and voice conversion, researchers [146], [159], [166]
use subjective evaluation metrics like Mean Opinion Score
(MOS) and Similarity Mean Opinion Score (SMOS) to assess
naturalness and emotional similarity. Accuracy is another
important evaluation metric for human emotion synthesis.
For example, in face reenactment, researchers use classifiers
to assess generated facial images. Higher accuracy in ex-
pression recognition reflects higher accuracy in expression
translation by the models [96]. Similarly, [23] utilizes an
emotion classifier network from EVP [226] to measure the
emotion accuracy of face manipulation.
In addition to the aforementioned universal evaluation
metrics, different modalities in the field of emotion syn-
thesis have their own specific and widely used evaluation
indicators. These indicators target the unique attributes
and synthesis goals of each modality, providing a more
fine-grained and specialized assessment perspective. For
example, in facial emotion synthesis, PSNR (Peak Signal-
to-Noise Ratio) [107], [227] quantifies image quality by
comparing compressed images to their originals. It is cal-
culated using the logarithm of the ratio between maximum
pixel value and mean squared error, with higher values
indicating better quality. SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
[96] improves upon PSNR by evaluating image similarity
based on luminance, contrast, and structure, focusing on
perceived quality and structural integrity. FID (Fréchet In-
ception Distance) [91] measures the similarity between sets
of images by comparing feature vectors, with lower scores
indicating higher quality and diversity in generated images.
In speech emotion synthesis, MCD (Mel Cepstral Distortion)
[166], [228] objectively measures spectral similarity between
reference and generated mel-spectrograms, providing quan-
titative feedback on emotional voice synthesis accuracy. F0
RMSE (F0 Root Mean Square Error) [81], [158] evaluates
the accuracy of the fundamental frequency contour in syn-
thesized speech compared to the reference. Lower values
indicate higher pitch accuracy, contributing to perceived
naturalness and expressiveness. In textual emotion synthe-
sis, the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score [26],
[186], borrowed from machine translation evaluation, canmeasure lexical similarity between generated and reference
texts, indicating how well the generated text maintains
desired linguistic properties while altering emotional tone.
PPL (Perplexity) [185] measures a language model’s predic-
tion accuracy, reflecting its ability to produce coherent and
fluent text. Lower PPL suggests the generated text more
closely mirrors human language patterns.

11 D ISCUSSION
11.1 Major Findings
Existing methods in generative technology for human emo-
tion synthesis have made substantial progress across mul-
tiple modalities, including facial images, speech, and text.
Each modality benefits from distinct approaches and these
developments not only enhance the perceived emotional
intelligence of systems but also push the boundaries of how
machines can generate and interpret nuanced emotional
states.
In facial emotion synthesis, GAN-based methods used to
be the mainstream methods. However, in recent years, DM-
based methods have also gained considerable attention and
made significant progress. Specifically, some classical GAN-
based models, such as StarGAN and StyleGAN, excel at al-
tering the emotional expressions of faces but face challenges
when attempting to generate more subtle or complex emo-
tional states. Moreover, generating mixed emotions—that
is, facial expressions that convey a strong contrast of emo-
tions like happiness and sadness—still lacks finer control.
Comparatively, DM generates images through progressive
denoising, which avoids the problem of model collapse that
GANs may have when generating facial expressions. It alsoJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 18
shows strong adaptability in generating mixed emotions,
better capturing subtle expression changes and emotional
nuances, and can handle multiple combinations of emotions
in facial expressions.
Speech emotion synthesis achieved similar progress
through the adaptation of GANs and Seq2Seqs like Tacotron
[229], where emotional intonation is introduced into syn-
thesized speech. These models produce more natural and
expressive speech by adjusting vocal elements like pitch,
rhythm, and tone. However, recent research has also incor-
porated AEs, and DMs to further improve the emotional
depth and expressiveness of synthesized speech. Specifi-
cally, AEs are used to disentangle emotional features from
speaker identity, enabling more flexible emotion transfer
while preserving the naturalness of speech. DMs, with
their capacity for modeling complex data distributions, offer
promising results in generating emotional speech with high
fidelity and more controlled variations in prosody.
Textual emotion synthesis has increasingly leveraged
LLMs and Seq2Seq architectures, utilizing mechanisms like
sentiment control and emotional valence modulation to pro-
duce emotionally resonant content [230]. These systems are
often employed in applications such as empathetic chatbots
and emotionally responsive dialogue systems. Despite their
effectiveness, generating responses with emotional depth
that appropriately reflect varying levels of empathy, sym-
pathy, or other complex emotional tones based on user
inputs remains a challenge. Current models still struggle
with maintaining a balance between emotional expressive-
ness and conversational coherence, especially in response to
ambiguous or contextually nuanced inputs. Moreover, un-
derstanding the contextual triggers for emotional responses
and integrating them effectively into generative models will
be an ongoing research area.
In terms of evaluation metrics, quality assessment re-
mains a complex, multidimensional task that integrates
both subjective and objective indicators. Subjective metrics
typically involve human evaluation, which focus on cap-
turing the emotional authenticity, resonance, and overall
impression of the generated content. However, subjective
evaluations can be time-consuming and costly, and they are
influenced by individual biases and cultural differences. On
the other hand, objective metrics aim to quantify various
aspects of emotion synthesis using automated computa-
tional methods, such as accuracy, PSNR, etc. They provide
a scalable and reproducible way of assessment but may not
fully capture the emotional nuances and human-perceived
quality of the generated content. Future research directions
include developing more fine-grained subjective evaluation
methods to better capture the subtle differences in emotional
content and the complexity of human responses. At the
same time, improving objective metrics to more accurately
quantify various aspects of emotional expression and cor-
relating them with human judgments is also an important
area of research.
11.2 Future Perspectives
Advances in generative AI have revolutionized how we
simulate human emotions, creating more authentic and
nuanced emotional expressions. Looking ahead, several
promising avenues for further research can be explored:Firstly, combining the capabilities of different generative
models such as GANs, Seq2Seqs, AEs, DMs, and LLMs
holds promise for further enhancing the quality of gen-
erated outputs. Each model has its unique strengths and
limitations, and intelligently integrating them can compen-
sate for the shortcomings of individual models, enabling
more accurate and realistic emotion synthesis. By designing
innovative hybrid architectures that leverage the strengths
of each model, more powerful and comprehensive emotion
synthesis systems can be developed. These hybrid models
can seamlessly transition between different modalities, gen-
erating emotionally consistent and complementary outputs.
For instance, a model combining DMs with the insights of
Seq2Seq can generate high-quality emotional speech with
appropriate facial expressions and lip synchronization.
Secondly, the horizon of emotion synthesis is not limited
to common modalities like facial images, speech, and text.
As generative models continue to evolve, we may see mul-
timodal human emotion synthesis results [231], [232] in the
future, including modalities beyond those mentioned in this
paper, such as gesture [233] and physiological signals like
EEG and ECG. In addition, emerging cross-modal genera-
tive models, such as text-to-image (T2I), text-to-video (T2V),
and even text-to-3D, are poised to expand the creative and
interactive potential of emotion synthesis. T2I models can
generate imagery that resonates emotionally with written
narratives, producing visuals that reflect subtle emotional
undertones, while T2V models can bring stories to life
by translating emotional content into animated, visually
expressive scenes that engage audiences on a deeper emo-
tional level. Moreover, as the technology matures, the poten-
tial for converting image-based emotions into sound (e.g.,
generating soundscapes that mirror the mood of a visual
scene) opens up new dimensions for immersive experiences
in fields like VR [234] and interactive entertainment.
Thirdly, the integration of generative models with edge
devices—from server-based processing to smart termi-
nals—marks a pivotal shift in the accessibility and appli-
cation of emotion synthesis [235]. As the computational
power of edge devices continues to grow, there is a grow-
ing potential for real-time emotion generation and synthe-
sis directly on devices such as smartphones, wearables,
and VR headsets. This transition from centralized server
processing to edge computing opens up a wide range of
applications, enabling personalized, on-the-fly emotional
interactions. For instance, smart devices can analyze users’
facial expressions, voice tone, or even physiological sig-
nals, generating responsive emotional content that adapts
to the user’s immediate emotional state, location, or context.
Additionally, as AI models become more efficient, smaller-
scale devices like wearables or even IoT sensors [236] can
incorporate emotion-aware interactions, enhancing user ex-
perience in a range of industries—from healthcare, where
emotion synthesis can assist in mental health monitoring
and intervention, to retail, where it can personalize con-
sumer experiences in-store or online. In this new paradigm,
generative models are poised to provide immediate, adap-
tive emotional content, offering users a deeper connection
to the digital world.
Fourthly, human emotion synthesis holds the poten-
tial to drive profound transformations across a variety ofJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015 19
industries and can revolutionize domains such as digital
entertainment and filmmaking [237], [238]. In the realm of
digital entertainment, emotion synthesis lays the foundation
for highly immersive experiences, enabling virtual charac-
ters and environments to express emotions with a level
of authenticity rivaling that of human actors. By precisely
generating emotional nuances in facial expressions, vocal
tones, and body language, these technologies can elevate
interactive media to new heights. In film production, AI-
driven tools are already being employed to infuse emotional
depth into character performances, achieving more dynamic
and expressive storytelling that transcends the limitations
of traditional physical acting. Moreover, the combination
of AIGC video and emotion synthesis opens up new av-
enues for creation, empowering filmmakers to craft content
with emotionally evocative visual and auditory cues. This
presents opportunities for real-time emotional adjustments
within films, where characters’ emotional arcs can be dy-
namically altered based on audience feedback or narrative
shifts, further immersing viewers in the experience [239].
Through these advancements, the industry is entering a
new chapter where the integration of emotion synthesis will
unleash vast creative potential.
12 C ONCLUSION
This review presents a detailed investigation of current
generative technology for human emotion synthesis across
various modalities, including facial images, speech, and
text. It reveals how different genrative models, ranging
from well-established approaches like AEs and GANs to
emerging techniques such as DMs and LLMs, are capable of
generating complex emotional expressions with remarkable
depth and subtle nuances.
In Section 1, we introduce the background of human
emotion synthesis, a pivotal area of research within affective
computing. With the growing sophistication of generative
models, which possess advanced data modeling and multi-
modal generation capabilities, new avenues for emotion
synthesis are emerging. However, there is currently a lack
of comprehensive reviews on this subject. To address this
gap, we present the first survey of generative technology for
human emotion synthesis, building upon existing literature
and filling the void in current research. In Section 2, we
outline our rigorous literature screening strategy, which
allowed us to systematically collect and classify key research
in the field of generative models for emotion synthesis. In
Sections 3 to 6, we highlight the gaps between previous
reviews and our survey, demonstrating the novelty and sig-
nificance of our contribution. We also provide an overview
of emotion models and mathematics of generative models,
as well as commonly used datasets, offering a deeper under-
standing of the latest advancements in this interdisciplinary
field.
Sections 7 to 9 provide a detailed discussion of the latest
research on human emotion synthesis based on facial im-
ages, speech, and text. We categorize the specific tasks under
each modality, discuss the applications of different gener-
ative models, and summarize the performance of existing
works in comprehensive tables. We classify specific tasks
within each modality, analyze the distribution of differentmodels across these tasks, and discuss their strengths and
limitations in various contexts. For each modality, we sum-
marize the application models and performance of existing
works in comprehensive tables. Finally, in Sections 10 and
11, we summarize the commonly used evaluation metrics
for emotion synthesis and discuss the current state and
future development trends in this field, providing insights
into the challenges and opportunities faced by emotion
synthesis.
In summary, this review highlights the transformative
potential of existing generative models in shaping the future
of human emotion synthesis. These advancements will not
only enhance the granularity and authenticity of synthe-
sized emotions but also usher in a new era where machines
can resonate with the subtleties of human emotions, foster-
ing deeper and more empathetic connections.
